 mamluk.title: "Collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate"
 mamluk.desc: "In 1515, Sultan Selim I began the war which led to the Ottoman conquest Egypt and its dependencies. Mamluk cavalry proved no match for the Ottoman artillery and Janissary infantry. On 24 August 1516, at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, Mamluk Sultan Al-Ghawri was killed. Syria passed into Turkish possession, an event welcomed in many places as deliverance from the Mamluks. The Mamluk Sultanate survived in Egypt until 1517, when Selim captured Cairo. Although diminished in power, the Mamluks were retained by the Ottomans as an Egyptian ruling class, and the Burji family succeeded in regaining much of its influence.\n\nThe Mamluks are incredibly corrupted, and leaving them in privilege will do naught for Egypt. Nonetheless, without their support, we will be unable to rule this region as easily. What should we do?"
 mamluk.a: "We shall rule Egypt directly."
 mamluk.b: "Leave the Mamluks in power - our focus is elsewhere."

 novgorod_fall.title: "The Fall of Novgorod"
 novgorod_fall.desc: "Throughout the 14th century, Lithuania and Muscovy fought intensely for control of Novgorod and its extravagant wealth, accrued from control of the lucrative fur trade in the Russian north. As Muscovy grew in strength, its princes became an increasingly greater threat to Novgorod. Thus, the Novgordians began to turn to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for security, pursuing an alliance in the 1470s. However, this encouraged the wrath of Muscovy, and so Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan III went to war with Novgorod and took the city in 1478 - he destroyed the Veche bell, the ancient symbol of Novgorod's republican traditions, and ended the independence of Novgorod. \n\nA Muscovite onslaught has the potential to instill incredible fear, horror, and anger among the once free and prosperous Novgorodian people. Should Muscovy seize the lands of the north?"
 novgorod.a: "Bring the Novgorodian domains into the Muscovite fold!"
 novgorod.b: "Allow the Novgorodians to remain free."
 novgorod_rebels: "The Fall of Novgorod"
 desc_novgorod_rebels: "The Novgorodians are incensed by the destruction of their republic and its symbols, and seek earnestly to overthrow Muscovite rule."
 qara.title: "Collapse of the Qara Qoyunlu"
 qara.desc: "Born from the ruins of the Timurid Empire, the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu were rival hordes known respectively as the White Sheep and Black Sheep Turkomans.

In 1467, Uzun Hasan, the Shahanshah of the Aq Qoyunlu, defeated Jahan Shah, the Sultan of the Qara Qoyunlu at the Battle of Chapakchur. Jahan Shah was slain in battle and the Qara Qoyunlu promptly collapsed, with their lands being rapidly subsumed by their rivals. \n\nShould we seize the territories of our enemies?"

 qara.b: "No, be merciful to the Black Sheep Turkomans."
