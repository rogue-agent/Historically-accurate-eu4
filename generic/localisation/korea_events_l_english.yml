 korea.1.t: "The Invention of Hangul"
 korea.1.d: "In the past, the Korean people wrote primarily using Classical Chinese and native phonetic writing systems thousands of years old. Since learning Classical Chinese was difficult, literacy was largely restricted to the upper class and most of Korea was left illiterate, impeding the dissemination of literature and ideas. However, King Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty sought to amend this situation, and thus developed a new Korean alphabet, which would come to be known as Hangul. The project was completed by January 1444, forever changing the Korean language as Hangul entered Korean popular culture. Hangul helped introduce a great enthusiasm for reading among the common people, and is still regarded as one of the most phonologically faithful writing systems in use around the world today."
