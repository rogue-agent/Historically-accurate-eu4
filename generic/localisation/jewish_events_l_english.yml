 jewish.1.t: "The Fair Treatment of the Jews"
 jewish.1.d: "The Jews of $COUNTRY$ have long enjoyed the fruits of prosperity under the reign of $MONARCH$, who has proven to be a wise and generous ruler. In $COUNTRY$, the Jews have been treated with kindness and equity, and have been protected from the prejudice and threat of expulsion they have long faced elsewhere. As such, our enlightened treatment of the Jewish people has paid its dividends in the growing wealth and stability of our nation."
 jewish.1.a: "Tolerance is the path to progress."
 jewish.2.t: "The Cruel Sufferings of the Jews"
 jewish.2.d: "Prejudice and hatred against the Jews is not new to the lands of Europe. Throughout practically all their history in Europe, the Jewish people endured bitter hardships as they were expelled from many lands, with their properties seized and stolen by predatory opportunists coming from all classes of European society. Enduring forced conversions, resettlement into ghettoes, and the denigration of their faith, the Jewish people suffered greatly from the intolerance and cruelty of their gentile neighbors. As a result, the European Jews often fled to faraway lands, searching endlessly for refuge and a better life."
 jewish.2.a: "Tragic."
 jewish.3.t: "Jewish Refugees"
 jewish.3.d: "Jewish refugees have come to us from the lands of $FROMCOUNTRY$, seeking protection from persecution and intolerance. The people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ long mistreated and abused the Jews, forcing them to flee in order to find safety. While the Jewish people have much to offer our country, accepting them could anger the clerical elites who have long antagonized the Jews. What should we do?"
 jewish.3.a: "Give the Jews safe haven."
 jewish.3.b: "Deny the Jews from these lands."
 jewish.4.t: "The Jewish People Arrive in Poland"
 jewish.4.d: "From the time of its founding in 1052 to the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth formed in 1569, Poland was the most religiously tolerant country in all of Europe. As a result, Poland became Europe's principal center of Jewish community and culture, with 750,000 Jews by the year 1764, more than half the world's Jewish population at the time. The Jewish people left an indelible mark on Polish society, becoming one of the most vibrant minorities in Europe, establishing a profoundly intellectual and religious culture that was defined in many ways by the pioneering of Talmudic learning and Rabbinical scholarship. Although the Deluge and the later partitions of Poland would deeply disrupt the national life of the country later on in its histroy, the Jewish people would remaining a fundamental pillar of Polish society until the 20th century."
 jewish.4.a: "They are welcome to stay here."
 jews_in_poland: "The Jews of Poland"
 desc_jews_in_poland: "Poland has become a safe haven for Jews from all over Europe, resulting in the continued growth of the country's cities."
 jewish.5.t: "The Jews of Provence"
 jewish.5.d: "On September 17, 1394, King Charles VI of France published an ordinance demanding the expulsion of the Jews for supposed crimes they had committed against the Christians. Although Charles VI's ordinance was not strictly enforced, it did encourage some Jewish migration to Provence, a longtime Jewish haven which lay outside the immediate authority of the French crown. However, the County of Provence was later inherited by the Kingdom of France, and so in 1498, Louis XII issued a general expulsion of the Jews of Provence in one of his first acts as king. This time, the expulsion was forcefully implemented, and the Jews of Provence were forced to either convert or leave the realm entirely. Until the 17th century, there would not again be a significant Jewish community in France."
 jewish.5.a: "Unfortunate."
 jewish.6.t: "Cum nimis absurdum"
 jewish.6.d: "Cum nimis absurdum was a papal bull issued by Pope Paul IV on July 14, 1555, known by its first words, \"Since it is absurd and utterly inconvenient that the Jews, who through their own fault were condemned by God to eternal slavery...\"\nFollowing the issuing of this papal bull, economic restrictions were placed on the Jews of the Papal States, and all 2,000 of the Jews of Rome were forced to move to the Roman Ghetto, a walled quarter with three gates locked by night. Jewish men were forced to wear a yellow pointed hat, while Jewish women were forced to wear a yellow kerchief, and all were forced to attend compulsory Catholic sermons on the Jewish shabbat. The Roman Ghetto and its severe degradation of the Jews endured until its abolition by the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1882."
 jewish.6.a: "It is necessary for our faith."
 roman_ghetto: "The Roman Ghetto"
 desc_roman_ghetto: "The Jews of Rome, in addition to the typical discrimination they endured, were forced by the Pope to reside in the Roman Ghetto, a walled quarter of the city that was locked at night. It would not be abolished for more than three hundred years."
 jewish.7.t: "The Abolition of the Roman Ghetto"
 jewish.7.d: "We have taken the city of Rome, and with it, can now observe the consequences of the poor conduct and insolence of the popes. Apparently, the Roman Jews were forced by a papal bull to live in a walled ghetto inside the city, where they were kept locked in by three gates that were never to open at night, all the while being forced to observe Catholic ceremonies on their religious holidays and needing to wear yellow clothing to identify their faith. It is well that we now have the power to eliminate this most injurious and inhumane institution."
 jewish.7.a: "Does the depravity of popes know any end?"
