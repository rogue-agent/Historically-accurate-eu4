 breton_inheritance.t: "The Mad War"
 breton_inheritance.d: "In 1485, the French king Charles VIII began the Mad War against the Duchy of Brittany and its allies in a bid to reassert French dominance over the duchy and expand royal power. The ensuing war resulted in a French victory and the marriage of the heiress to the Duchy of Brittany, Anne, to Charles VIII after her previous marriage was annulled by the Pope. Brittany would fall under a personal union with France, and never again leave the sphere of the Kingdom. \n\nShould we seize the Duchy of Brittany?"

The ensuing war resulted in a French victory and the marriage of the heiress to the Duchy of Brittany, Anne, to Charles VIII after her previous marriage was annulled by the Pope.

However, other powers are wary of French expansion."

 french_claim_milan.t: "Curious Claims to the Duchy of Milan"
 french_claim_milan.d: "Even before he became King of France, Louis XII claimed the Duchy of Milan as his own inheritance, for his paternal grandmother was Valentina Visconti. While the claims of Louis XII to the dukedom remained tenuous, they were substantial enough to justify his conquest of Milan in 1500, and Louis XII would rule the city until 1512."

 french_burgundy_ask.d: "Following the inheritance of the Duchy of Burgundy, France seized control of most of the Duchy's territories outside the Holy Roman Empire, including the County of Artois, the County of Charolais, and the Free County of Burgundy. However, the Habsburgs, who had inherited the Low Countries, still laid claim to these provinces. In 1493, King Charles VIII of France signed the Treaty of Senlis, ceding these provinces to the Habsburgs in return for more freedom to interfere in Italian affairs. \n\nIt is possible for us to negotiate with France for the cession of some of the Burgundian provinces, but this comes with the risk that France will direct its aggressive foreign policy elsewhere. Should we ask for the return of some of the Burgundian territories?"
 french_burgundy_ask.a: "Let us try and negotiate with the King of France."
 french_burgundy_ask.b: "There is no need for us to continue pressing these claims."
 french_burgundy_response.t: "The Treaty of Senlis"
 french_burgundy_response.d: "The inheritors of the Duchy of Burgundy have come to negotiate a treaty with us. They propose that we cede some of our Burgundian territories to them, in return for a truce.

 french_inheritance.13.t: "The Inheritance of $COUNTRY$"
 french_inheritance.13.d: "For hundreds of years, France was a decentralized state, similar to the Holy Roman Empire in that the King of France struggled to maintain control over the rest of the country while attempting to exert influence from a limited royal domain. The reluctance of the King of England to pay him homage as the Duke of Aquitaine was what began the Hundred Years' War, during which other ostensibly French lands, including the Duchy of Brittany and the Duchy of Burgundy, began to increasingly assert their own independence. However, now the lands of $COUNTRY$ has been inherited by the King of France, reducing the number of petty nobles who might pose an internal threat to the stability of the kingdom. France is now one step closer to truly becoming an undivided nation-state."
