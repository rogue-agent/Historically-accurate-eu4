 swiss_confederation.3.t: "Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire"
 swiss_confederation.3.d: "For centuries, Switzerland has been a part of the Holy Roman Empire, and many of its rural and urban territories enjoyed imperial immediacy in answering directly to the emperor. However, in the time since Switzerland became a part of the Empire, Imperial control over Italy has been lost, and the Swiss people have begun to forge a new national identity. In these changing times, it may be more fitting to find an independent path for the Republic of the Swiss."

 swiss_confederation.4.d: "Although the Alpine territories of Switzerland were a part of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries, Imperial influence there has waned, as the country's independently minded communes have begun to disregard the Empire as a source of protection. Instead, the people of Switzerland now look to each other for the establishment of a mutual defense, and claim to have developed a new national identity. As a result, the Swiss declare that they are no longer subjects of the Holy Roman Empire."
 swiss_confederation.4.a: "Unsettling."
 swiss_confederation.5.t: "Switzerland Remains in the Empire"
 swiss_confederation.5.d: "The Alpine territories of Swtizerland were a part of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries. Nonetheless, with the waning of Imperial influence in Italy, the citizens of Switzerland began to openly discuss the potential for their independence from the Holy Roman Empire, citing the strength and reliability of their alliance compared to the protection provided by the Emperor. However, acknowledging the gravity of foreign threats, the leadership of Switzerland has ultimately decided that it is wiser to remain within the Holy Roman Empire, warning of an uncertain future if their country is to leave its boundaries."
 swiss_confederation.5.a: "A judicious choice."
