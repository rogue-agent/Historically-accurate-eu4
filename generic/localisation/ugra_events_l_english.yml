 ugra.1.t: "The Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.1.d: "In 1237, the ferocious Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' commenced with the Battle of the Kalka River. The mighty Batu Khan, grandson of Temüjin and founder of the Golden Horde, led a sweeping campaign of pillage and destruction through the Rus' lands, destroying many great cities and the neighboring civilizations of Cumania and Volga Bulgaria. By 1242, all the Rus' lands owed allegiance to the Great Khan.\nIn the last century though, our hold over the principalities Rus' has weakened. The power of $COUNTRY$ has declined, and with it the ability to keep the northern princes in check. Muscovy has become the greatest of the domains to emerge from the Rus' lands, and their preeminence has become a threat to the continuation of our way of life. For the sake of our own security, the Muscovite threat must be dealt with."
 ugra.1.a: "Demand that the Muscovites pay tribute!"
 ugra.1.a.tooltip: "The Muscovites may refuse our demands."
 ugra.1.b: "Let us keep to the steppes."
 ugra.2.t: "The Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.2.d: "In 1237, the ferocious Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' commenced with the Battle of the Kalka River. The mighty Batu Khan, grandson of Temüjin and founder of the Golden Horde, led a sweeping campaign of pillage and destruction through the Rus' lands, destroying many great cities and the neighboring civilizations of Cumania and Volga Bulgaria. By 1242, all the Rus' lands owed allegiance to the Great Khan.\nIn the last century though, $COUNTRY$ has become a rich and prosperous land, preeminent among the states of Rus'. The growth of our power has apparently become a threat to the khans of the $FROMCOUNTRY$, who now look upon us with fear and apprehension. As a result, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ now demands that we pay it tribute, or otherwise its warriors will once again fall upon our cities, like those who came before them. The armies of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ are now amassed on the banks of the Ugra River, scarcely more than a stone's throw away from our own."
 ugra.2.a: "Let us continue paying tribute for now."
 ugra.2.a.tooltip: "As long as Muscovy continues to pay tribute to foreign powers, it will not be possible to unite the Rus' lands into a new nation."
 ugra.2.b: "We fear no khan."
 ugra.2.b.tooltip: "We may be forced to go to war."
 ugra.3.t: "The End of the Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.3.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has chosen to step away from its claim of mastery over the lands of Rus'. Allegedy, they now claim to hold no interest in our ostensibly pitiful cities, rejecting our sedentary and civilized way of life. Thus the ambassadors of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ have stated that they will keep to the steppes."
 ugra.3.a: "And there they will stay."
 ugra.4.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Submits!"
 ugra.4.d: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to submit to the demands of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, acknowledging our primacy over the lands of Rus'. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us tribute in order to appease our belligerent forces."
 ugra.4.a: "A wise choice."
 ugra.5.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Rejects the Yoke!"
 ugra.5.d: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to submit to the demands of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$! The people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are apparently incensed at our attempt to reassert our primacy over Rus', and there is talk of war. How should we respond to $FROMCOUNTRY$?"
 ugra.5.a: "We are sons of Temüjin! To war!"
 ugra.5.b: "Let us keep to the steppes."
 ugra.6.t: "The $FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares War!"
 ugra.6.d: "Angered by our refusal to submit to the Mongol Yoke, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared war! They say that they will raze our cities to the ground and destroy all that is left of Rus'. The $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made good on its promise to respond with force."
 ugra.6.a: "This time we will drive out the Tatars forever!"
