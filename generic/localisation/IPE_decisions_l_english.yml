However, in the years afterward, the Duchy of Bavaria was divided into multiple petty domains ruled by members of the House of Wittelsbach.

Amid this struggle, the peoples of Pomerania united and drove out the invaders, establishing for themselves a new and unique national identity. However, in the centuries since then, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided and redivided many times, rendering it weak and once again susceptible to foreign influence and invasion. To reunite the mighty Duchy of Pomerania would force the neighboring great powers to recognize a rising force on the shores of the Baltic."
