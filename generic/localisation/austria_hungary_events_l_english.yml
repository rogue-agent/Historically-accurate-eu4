 death_albertine_line.d: "Since 1379, the Albertine Line of the von Habsburgs had governed Lower Austria according to the Treaty of Neuberg. However, the death of Ladislaus von Postumus in 1457 marked the end of the Albertine Line, and thus Lower Austria came under the control of the Elder Ernestine Line, which already ruled in Styria. A significant portion of the von Habsburg lands has now been reunited. \n\nHowever, the fate of the lands of Hungary is still in question. Ladislaus had claim to the throne of Hungary, and now that he has died, it is possible that the Hungarian nobles may not elect another Habsburg ruler. Nonetheless, the fate of Hungary will shortly become known."

His death at such a young age was extremely unexpected, and initially, his contemporaries suspected his enemies of having poisoned him. However, a modern examination of Ladislaus' skeleton now suggests that the teenaged monarch either died of bubonic plague or leukemia. Whatever the case, Ladislaus' passing resulted in renewed dynastic conflict among the nations of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia, which would continue until the demise of Hungary at the hands of the Ottomans."

He has gathered many supporters in the region of Transylvania, and now has proposed an alliance to the Sublime Porte, asking for our help. If we will help him take the throne of Hungary, Zápolya says, he will acknowledge us as his suzerain and commit his forces to our further military operations in Europe.

The troops must be paid on a regular basis, for otherwise we would risk their desertion, or at worst, revolt. However, there is the possibility that we could convince the mercantile state of Venice to pay for some of the costs of the Black Army. While we have often come to blows with the Venetians over their territories in Dalmatia, it is clear that they are far more fearful of the Ottoman threat, and they may be willing to assist us with funding in order to deal with that threat."

It is primarily composed of foreign mercenaries, who are extremely disciplined and well-trained, holding their lines steadfastly even unto death. However, the maintenance of a fighting force of such high quality has come of significant financial cost to the Kingdom of Hungary, and as a result, Hungarian diplomats have now arrived in our country to ask for our assistance in defraying the expenses of this army. If we help the Hungarians maintain the Black Army, they will be more able to hold off the Ottoman threat which endangers our Adriatic posessions."
