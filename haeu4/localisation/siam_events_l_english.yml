 siam.1.t: "The Death of Borommaracha II"
 siam.1.d: "Following a long rule dating back from 1424, the King of Ayutthaya, Borommaracha II, has left this earth. However, during his lifetime, he married a daughter of the vassal prince of Sukhothai, who bore a son, Trailokanat. Trailokanat would go on to inherit Sukhothai upon the death of his grandfather and then Ayutthaya upon the death of his father, uniting the two kingdoms under a personal union and thus becoming known as the King of Siam."
 siam.1.a: "A wonderful development."
 siam.2.t: "The Death of Trailokanat"
 siam.2.d: "In years past, King Borommaracha II of Ayutthaya married a daughter of the vassal prince of Sukhothai, who bore a son, Prince Trailokanat. Prince Trailokanat thus became the heir to both the thrones of Ayutthaya and Sukhothai, and was placed on the throne of Sukhothai when he was but a child. Had Trailokanat outlived his father, he would have become the ruler of all Siam. However, Trailokanat has now died, and as a result, these two great Thai kingdoms will remain disunited for some time."
 siam.2.a: "A tragedy."
