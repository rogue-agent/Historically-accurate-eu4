 flavor_teu.5.t: "The Secularization of the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_teu.5.d: "In 1192, the Teutonic Order was established at Acre as a Catholic religious order in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, pursuing the twin objectives of defending pilgrims to the Holy Land and estalishing hospitals. In the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights committed their first military actions on the shores of the Baltic, crusading against the local pagan population, fighting against them with both swords and the word of God. However, the Teutonic Order soon become embroiled in territorial conflicts with the two neighboring powers, namely the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. These conflicts would define the majority of the Order's lifetime, as the Teutonic Order fought nine wars against Poland from the 14th to 16th century. However, the bitter feuding and enmity of Poland and the Teutonic Order finally came to a conclusive end in 1525, when Albert von Hohenzollern, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, converted to Lutheranism and secularized the Order's remnants into the Duchy of Prussia, a fief of the Polish kingdom. From that point on, relations between the people of Prussia and Poland would be amended, as the Prussians became valuable allies to the Polish state.\nHow will we regard the newly secularized Duchy of Prussia?"

 flavor_teu.8.t: "Protestantism in the Lands of Prussia"
 flavor_teu.8.d: "In 1522, Albert von Hohenzollern, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, became acquainted with Andreas Osiander, a German Lutheran theologoian and reformer. This would become one of the most meaningful acquaintances in European history, as Osiander convinced Albert on the merits of Protestant theology and the shortcomings of the Roman Catholic Church. By 1525, Albert had also met Martin Luther, who suggested that Albert should reject the authority of the pope and seize the lands of the Teutonic Order, secularizing them into his own duchy. Thus on February 10, Albert made a personal oath to King Sigismund I of Poland, and declared himself the Duke of Prussia. As a result, Albert made history, becoming the first ruler to establish Lutheranism as the state religion of his lands. The Protestant Reformation had truly begun.\nReformers have come into our lands to greet $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. They claim that they wish to have us join them in rejecting all of Catholicism's evils. What should be done?"
