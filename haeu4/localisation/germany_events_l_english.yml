 germany.1.t: "The Germanization of the Kashubians"
 germany.1.d: "Until the end of the 12th century, the vast majority of inhabitants in all parts of Pomerania were the speakers of Slavic languages. However, German immigration and the influx of German nobles, monks, and clergy in the years thereafter, encouraged by the Dukes of Pomerania, resulted in a gradual Germanization of the region. The Kashubians are perhaps the last major Slavic group in Pomerania, but now, local priests and nobles have made extremely active efforts to weed out the Kashubian language, transforming their subjects into Germans. This is perhaps the end of a recognizable Slavic minority in this region."
 germany.1.a: "Interesting."
