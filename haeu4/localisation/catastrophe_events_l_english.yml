 catastrophe.1.t: "The Ravages of Religious War"
 catastrophe.1.d: "The sheer carnage and bloodshed wrought by the Thirty Years' War produced one of the greatest demographic catastrophes in modern European history. It is estimated that one-third to one-half of the population of the Holy Roman Empire perished in the Thirty Years' War, with some regions suffering more devastation than others. Often times, it was the cruelty and greed of mercenary soldiers that brought about suffering on an enormous scale, as they burned entire towns and cities to the ground, maurading through the countryside, raping, murdering, and pillaging along the way. Many German settlements destroyed in the Thirty Years' War would not fully recover until more than 100 years later."
 catastrophe.1.a: "We are all tainted by the love of war."
