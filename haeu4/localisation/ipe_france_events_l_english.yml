 ipe_france.1.t: "The Mines of Paris"
 ipe_france.1.d: "Since the 13th century, the environs of Paris were mined extensively in order to extract stone from local limestone formations, which was used for construction all over the city. Eventually, three main networks of mines developed, made up of underground tunnels stretching for hundreds of kilometers. However, as the city expanded later on in its history, it began to absorb settlements and suburban areas built atop these mines, which became dangerously prone to collapse. When a Parisian street collapsed 100 feet under into the mines in 1774, the Royal Council decided that it would be necessary to inspect, maintain, and repair the tunnels beneath the city to ensure that such calamities would not happen again.\nEstablishing a new citywide organization to oversee the renovation of the mines would greatly improve safety within Paris and make it easier to build new construction in previously mined out areas. Although it would be a fairly costly venture, the mines in their current state present a constant danger to existing buildings and the lives of the Parisian public. What shall we do?"
 ipe_france.1.a: "Create an organization to inspect the mines!"
 ipe_france.1.b: "This is not an important matter."

 desc_inspected_mines: "For centuries, the environs of Paris were mined extensively in order to quarry limestone for local construction. Now, the hundreds of kilometers of mines beneath the city have been inspected and renovated, to ensure that they do not collapse as the city continues to develop."

 desc_uninspected_mines: "For centuries, the environs of Paris were mined extensively in order to quarry local limestone for local construction. However, the hundreds of kilometers of mines beneath the city have not been inspected and renovated, and as a result, are constantly at risk of collapse, endangering existing construction and people's lives."
 ipe_france.2.t: "The Catacombs of Paris"
 ipe_france.2.d: "Recently, we renovated the mines of Paris, doing maintenance, repair, and inspection work on the tunnels to ensure that they would not collapse again. Lately though, we have had problems regarding the local cemeteries, which, having been used for centuries, are now overflowing with millions of corpses. The situation is so severe that the cemetery's oldest corpses, reduced to nothing but skeletons, have been exhumed, and their bones packed into the surrounding roofs and walls. Already, the basement of a building bordering the cemetery has collapsed, filling it with a gruesome collection of decomposing bodies.\nCurrently, the Parisian cemeteries are far beyond capacity, constituting a public health and safety crisis. It has been suggested though that we could condemn Paris' urban cemeteries, and instead relocate all the bodies to the mines, perhaps creating an underground series of catacombs for the dead. While this would be an extremely expensive and time-consuming project, involving the moving of millions of bodies, it may be necessary to ensure that the dead are able to rest in peace with any semblance of dignity."
 ipe_france.2.a: "Let us construct the Catacombs of Paris."
 ipe_france.2.b: "Leave the dead be."

 desc_catacombs_of_paris: "A small portion of the extensive mine network beneath Paris has been apportioned for what is now known as the Catacombs of Paris, a gargantuan ossuary storing perhaps six million bodies. This has not only alleviated Paris' crisis regarding the overflowing cemeteries, but also provides a peculiar and macabre attraction for those few brave souls who choose to explore the labyrinth, which has been designed as a mausoleum."
 ipe_france.3.t: "Sampiero Corso"
 ipe_france.3.d: "Sampiero Corso, a Corsican soldier long in the service of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, has come to us with an intriguing proposition regarding the Italian city-state of Genoa. He tells us of dissent on the island of Corsica against Genovese rule, and suggests that if we would support his leading of a military venture on the island, he could secure its independence from Genoa. This is a unique proposition that could help us expand our influence in the Mediterranean."
 ipe_france.3.a: "Let us support Corso's military expedition."
 ipe_france.3.b: "He would make a good advisor."
 ipe_france.4.t: "Sampiero Corso"
 ipe_france.4.d: "The petulant French have supported a revolt on the island of Corsica led by the soldier Sampiero Corso, who hails from the island. He has organized a band of mercenaries, French troops, and local rebels, swiftly seizing control of the island. If we do not act quickly, we may lose control of Corsica."
 ipe_france.4.a: "They will pay for this!"

 ipe_france.5.t: "The French Toll System"
 ipe_france.5.d: "In the 17th and 18th century, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. This not only discouraged trade and transportation, but also made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad rather than from a neighboring city.\nIt was up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres' worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, as a consequence of paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other.\nIf the French economy is to grow and become prosperous, it will be necessary to reform this archaic and backward toll system, so that commerce can flow freely once again."
 ipe_france.5.a: "We must reform the toll system!"
 ipe_france.5.b: "There is no need to change tradition."
