 scottish_survival.6.t: "The Plantations of Ireland"
 scottish_survival.6.d: "Starting in the middle of the 16th century, the English government began a deliberate policy of seizing native Irish lands and settling the island with colonists from Great Britain, including English, Welsh, and Scottish planters. Gradually, the scale of the plantations increased, reaching a peak during the time of the English Civil War. Eventually, a large Protestant English ruling class would become established in Ireland, which would later become known as the Protestant Ascendancy. However, the mistreatment of the Irish by the English did not go by with impunity, and many revolts took place there throughout the years, sometimes supported by foreign powers such as France. Nonetheless, the Plantations of Ireland forever changed the demographics of the island, leading to the decline of Gaelic culture as the English came to dominate local affairs."
