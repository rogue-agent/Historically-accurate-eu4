 new_dutch.1.t: "The Spread of the Dutch Language"
 new_dutch.1.d: "For centuries, people in the northeastern part of the Netherlands have spoken Dutch Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German. However, since the formation of the Dutch nation and the beginning of our administration in the area, the influence of the Dutch language has gradually found its way into all corners of society. As a result, more and more people in the northeastern Netherlands now are speaking Dutch than ever before. People are beginning to identify themselves not as Germans, but members of the Dutch nation."
