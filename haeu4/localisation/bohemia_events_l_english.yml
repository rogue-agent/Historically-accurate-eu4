 flavor_boh.12.t: "The Bohemian Succession"
 flavor_boh.12.d: "In 1438, Albrecht II von Habsburg, at that point having recently become the King of Hungary, was crowned King of Bohemia. Although Albrecht II was also elected King of Germany and therefore was a strong candidate for Holy Roman Emperor, his aspirations were cut short when he died shortly after a battle with the Ottoman Turks in 1439.\nHowever, Albrecht II did leave behind a son, who was only born shortly after his death, Ladislaus the Posthumous, known in Latin as Ladislaus Postumus. To Ladislaus, Albrecht II bequeathed all his lands and titles, including the kingship of Bohemia, despite having never actually taken full control of that country. Now that Ladislaus Postumus is dead, his claim to the throne of Hungary has passed on to yet another line of Habsburgs.\nConsquently, we are now faced with a choice. Either we can respect the claims of the Habsburg rulers, and join our lands ot theirs in personal union, or we can continue an independent path under our current monarch. What shall we do?"
 flavor_boh.12.a: "We need no von Habsburgs on our throne."
 flavor_boh.12.b: "A German king would be best!"
 flavor_boh.13.t: "The Bohemian Throne"
 flavor_boh.13.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has suddenly died, rather suspiciously, leaving the throne vacant. The [From.GetAdjective] Diet has ignored that their former [From.Monarch.GetTitle] belonged to the Habsburg dynasty and elected their own [From.Monarch.GetTitle], completely ignoring our legitimate claim to the throne."
 flavor_boh.13.a: "War is the continuation of politics by other means..."
 flavor_boh.14.t: "Union with Bohemia"
 flavor_boh.14.d: "Our kinsman on the throne of Bohemia has suddenly died without an heir. This is rather tragic, but a great boon to us, as the Hungarian nobility has elected $MONARCH$ to become $MONARCHTITLE$ of Bohemia."
 flavor_boh.15.t: "Ladislaus Comes of Age"
 flavor_boh.15.d: "Despite the fact that Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg had right to the kingship of Bohemia through his father, Albrecht II, the country of Bohemia never actually came under his control once he came of age. Instead, while Ladislaus Postumus was indeed crowned King of Bohemia, Jirí z Podebrady, leader of the moderate Hussite lords, served as Governor of Bohemia and was its true sovereign until shortly after Ladislaus' death in 1457, at which point Jirí took the throne of Bohemia himself.\nNow, Ladislaus has come of age to rule in the Kingdom of Hungary. Although we do not necessarily have to allow Ladislaus to rule in Bohemia if we respect his claim to our throne, recognizing him as King of Bohemia could pose a long-term risk to our independence. However, refusing to recognize Ladislaus' claim would continue the technical state of interregnum in our country, and incense lords sympathetic to the Habsburgs. What shall we do?"
 flavor_boh.15.a: "Allow Ladislaus to be crowned King of Bohemia."
 flavor_boh.15.b: "The Bohemian throne is ours alone!"
 flavor_boh.16.d: "Ladislaus is now both the King of Bohemia and the leader of a branch of the Austrian Habsburgs. In these circumstances, there will now be a personal union between Ladislaus' realms and those of Bohemia."
 flavor_boh.17.t: "The Succession of Jirí"
 flavor_boh.17.d: "Following the death of Ladislaus Postumus, the titular Habsburg King of Bohemia, in 1457, Jirí z Podebrad, a moderate Hussite lord who had hitherto served as Ladislaus' regent, seized the Bohemian crown for himself. However, the takeover of Bohemia by the Hussites was not well received by the country's Catholic neighbors, who, under the leadership of King Mátyás Corvinus of Hungary, conspired to bring about the Hussites' downfall. Consequently, when Jirí z Podebrad died, the desperate Bohemian nobles sought an ally to protect themselves from Hungarian aggression.\nIt has become known to us that one of the sons of the Polish monarch, Wladyslaw Jagiellon, is eager to become a sovereign ruler in his own right, and will even take up the mantle of leadership for our war-torn kingdom. Allowing him to take our throne could greatly improve our relationships with Poland, a kingdom which could serve as a powerful ally in protecting us from the wrath of Hungary. With the enemies of Bohemia looming and ascendant, it will be a daunting task for Wladyslaw to lead the nation through the coming years. Should we entrust our fate to this aspiring noble?"
 flavor_boh.17.a: "We need a Jagiellon!"
 flavor_boh.17.b: "We are fine with our current rulers."

 no_polish_king_in_bohemia: "Wladyslaw Refused"
 flavor_boh.18.d: "Following the death of his rival, the Hungarian king Mátyás Corvinus in 1490, Wladyslaw, the King of Bohemia, laid claim to the Hungarian throne, as his mother, Elizabeth von Habsburg, was the sister of the preceding King of Hungary, Ladislaus Postumus. After a brief campaign against Mátyás' son János, who also claimed the Hungarian throne, Wladyslaw became the King of Hungary, and fended off similar claims to the throne from his own brother, Jan I Olbracht, and Maximilian I, the Archduke of Austria. Bohemia would remain in personal union under Hungary until the latter's collapse at the hands of the Ottoman Empire."
