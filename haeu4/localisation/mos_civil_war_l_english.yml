 MOS_civil_war.1.t: "The Muscovite Civil War"
 MOS_civil_war.1.d: "In 1389 the prince of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy died, resulting in his son Vasily I becoming Grand Prince. However Donskoy willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then the successor would be Vasily's brother, Yury Dmitrievich of Zvenigorod. Although Yury posed no direct threat to Vasily I during his reign, problems quickly arised at the beginning of Vasily II's rule. The existing rule of succession outlined that the oldest living brother, which was Yury Dmitrievich, should have received the crown and not Vasily II, who was the son of Vasily I and therefore second in line to the throne. In 1433 Yury staged an invasion of the principality, entering Moscow and declaring himself Grand Prince. But after his sudden death, Vasily II was able to regain control of Moscow and allied himself with Dmitry Shemyaka, a son of Yury Dmitrievich. Coupled with this was the threat of the newly-formed Khanate of Kazan, whose forces laid siege to Moscow in 1439. We may have repulsed the Tatars and taken back control of the throne for now, but we are uncertain as to the future of our nation..."
 MOS_civil_war.1.a: "Troubling times for Moscow."
 MOS_civil_war.1.a.tt: "Kazan may attack us again - we must prepare ourselves."
 MOS_civil_war.2.t: "Question of the Qasim Khanate"
 MOS_civil_war.2.d: "Ever since the foundation of the Khanate of Kazan, we have desired to retake lands formerly under overlordship of the Tatars. One such area which we have grounds to claim is Kasimov, currently under Muscovite control, since the majority who reside there still share our faith. As the Muscovite Civil War rages on, a new opportunity to seize these lands has resurfaced as the governance of Vasily II is weak."
 MOS_civil_war.2.a: "Demand that they cede Kasimov."
 MOS_civil_war.2.b: "We have more pressing concerns."
 MOS_civil_war.2.tt: "If the Muscovites refuse our demands, we will respond with a declaration of war."
 MOS_civil_war.9.t: "Kazan Agrees to Peace"
 MOS_civil_war.9.d: "We waited silently for the inevitable declaration of war by the Khan of Kazan, as tensions grew once again. But in a surprise diplomatic move the Khan instead vowed that they would not attack us - at least, for now. The intentions of the Khan remain a mystery, but this development will allow us to deal with our raging civil war."
 MOS_civil_war.9.a: "Let this be a lesson to all others who wish to take advantage of us."
 MOS_civil_war.3.t: "Kazan Demands Kasimov"
 MOS_civil_war.3.d: "We have received a message from the Khan of Kazan, demanding that we cede the territories of the Qasim Khanate. They also warn us that if we do not comply, they will respond with war. What shall we do, $MONARCHTITLE$?"
 MOS_civil_war.3.a: "Refuse to cede the land."
 MOS_civil_war.3.b: "Concede to their demands."
 MOS_civil_war.4.t: "Muscovy Refuses Our Demands"
 MOS_civil_war.4.d: "To our outrage, the Muscovites have openly refused our demands to hand Kasimov over to us. Inevitably, we must heed our promises and declare war."
 MOS_civil_war.4.a: "They knew what would happen..."
 MOS_civil_war.4.a.tt: "Declare war on §YMuscovy§!"
 MOS_civil_war.5.t: "Muscovy Accepts Our Demands"
 MOS_civil_war.5.d: "Although we assumed that Muscovy would fight for Kasimov, we did not expect that they would yield to our demands. As a result we have gained back the rightful Tatar territory of Kasimov. However, we now face the task of what to do with the newly conquered territory. Qasim Khan, the son of the Khan of Kazan, is eager to take ownership of this new land."
 MOS_civil_war.5.a: "Create the Qasim Khanate."
 MOS_civil_war.5.b: "Seize the territory directly."
 MOS_civil_war.19.t: "Vasily II is Captured!"
 MOS_civil_war.19.d: "As the Tatar forces advanced into Muscovy, a Muscovite detachment under Vasily II was suddenly taken by surprise. The resulting battle was disastrous, and the Tatars captured several Muscovite nobles as well as Vasily II himself, destroying the morale of the Muscovite troops. In his absence, a period of interregnum has casted its shadow over Muscovy - or has it?\n     \nVasily II's close ally, Dmitry Shemyaka has proposed to the nobility still in Muscovite lands that he should rule as regent until Vasily II returns, on the grounds that he has a rightful claim to the Grand Princedom, being descended from Yury Dmitrievich. However, the existing nobility are torn between support for both Vasily II and Dmitry Shemyaka. Some supporters of Vasily II argue that this could be detrimental to the existing line of succession, even though he has been loyal to us so far."
 MOS_civil_war.19.a: "Elect Dmitry Shemyaka as Regent."
 MOS_civil_war.19.b: "We will get the Grand Prince back to Moscow. Just hang in there..."
 MOS_civil_war.20.t: "Fate of Vasily II"
 MOS_civil_war.20.d.1: "After the unexpected capture of Vasily II, we have been presented with the prospect of his release - however, we would need to pay an enormous ransom. Alternatively, we could leave him to spend the rest of his days in a Tatar prison. But not having enough in our coffers to pay the ransom might complicate the situation, if we are not prepared to run into a deficit..."
 MOS_civil_war.20.d.2: "After the unexpected capture of Vasily II, we have been presented with the prospect of his release - however, we would need to pay an enormous ransom. Alternatively, we could leave him to spend the rest of his days in a Tatar prison. Luckily, we have enough money in our coffers to afford to pay for the return of Vasily II to Moscow. Let us hope we do not make the same mistake again..."
 MOS_civil_war.20.a: "Offer to ransom Vasily II."
 MOS_civil_war.20.a.tt: "We will offer §Y200§! ducats to the Khan of Kazan to ransom Vasily II."
 MOS_civil_war.20.b: "It's too expensive."
 MOS_civil_war.20.b.tt: "We will not have another chance to release Vasily II."
 MOS_civil_war.22.t: "Vasily II is Released"
 MOS_civil_war.22.d: "After extensive negotiations with the Khanate of Kazan, they have finally arranged for the safe return of Vasily II to Moscow. Subsequently Dmitry Shemyaka will be deprived of his role as regent, and we will be able to focus on recovering from the repercussions of the civil war."
 MOS_civil_war.22.a: "It is good to see him back."
 MOS_civil_war.23.t: "Kazan Declines Our Ransom Offer"
 MOS_civil_war.23.d: "Our diplomats made a major blunder in their attempts to negotiate with Kazan, and as a result of this the Khan did not seem to be convinced of our intentions. He tells us that Vasily II will be locked away until he perishes, for refusing to accept the supremacy of the Tatars. This will have major consequences further onward in our history."
 MOS_civil_war.23.a: "Quickly appoint Vasily's heir at once!"
 MOS_civil_war.23.b: "Amid this chaos, I will usurp the throne!"
 MOS_civil_war.6.t: "Rebellion of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.6.d: "Today we have received word that Dmitry Shemyaka, our former close ally has unexpectedly started a rebellion against our rule, claiming the Muscovite throne in his name! He has managed to gather support within our nation and march a large army on the capital."
 MOS_civil_war.6.a: "Like father, like son..."
 MOS_civil_war.7.t: "Flight of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.7.d: "Shemyaka's lack of support among the Muscovite boyars has led him to flee the principality. Despite our best attempts to bring the rebel Shemyaka to justice, we have yet to capture him. We do not know where Shemyaka has escaped, but nonetheless have three courses of action, all of which have their risks. What shall we do about Dmitry Shemyaka, $MONARCHTITLE$?"
 MOS_civil_war.7.a: "Maybe some poison ought to do it..."
 MOS_civil_war.7.a.tt: "Perhaps spies can kill Dmitry Shemyaka."
 MOS_civil_war.7.b: "Search every town in the north, he must be hiding somewhere!"
 MOS_civil_war.7.c: "We have no choice but to let him share power in the realm."
 MOS_civil_war.10.t: "Shemyaka is Assassinated"
 MOS_civil_war.10.d: "Thanks to the cunning of our agents, we managed to trace Shemyaka's whereabouts to the city of Novgorod, where we bribed his cook to poison him. The assassination attempt was successful, putting an end to the false line of Muscovite princes."
 MOS_civil_war.10.a: "The troubles of the civil war are now behind us."
 MOS_civil_war.11.t: "Plot to Kill Shemyaka Fails!"
 MOS_civil_war.11.d: "Due to the incompetence of our spies, the dastardly Shemyaka has managed to escape unharmed once again, this time to somewhere in Lithuania after we attempted to assassinate him in Novgorod. Furthermore, the agents' alliegance to $MONARCH$ was exposed, destroying our reputation. To add further insult to injury a local supporter of Shemyaka, Ivan of Mozhaisk has gathered a sizeable force to march on Moscow, claiming revenge for our dishonourable actions. Though the threat of Shemyaka himself is gone, there is no denying that there is still no end in sight to the civil war."
 MOS_civil_war.11.a: "I should never have trusted those bastards!"
 MOS_civil_war.12.t: "Remnants of Shemyaka's Alliance"
 MOS_civil_war.12.d: "Though we successfully brought an end to the civil war that had plagued our nation for the past three decades, there is still much reorganising of the realm to be done. The rights of Dmitry Shemyaka's former hereditary patrimony of Galich and the lands of the rebel Ivan of Mozhaisk should be curtailed in order to ensure that no revolt breaks out again. However on the other hand, confiscating the lands of the boyars will deeply upset them."
 MOS_civil_war.12.a: "Confiscate the rebellious holdings!"
 MOS_civil_war.12.b: "Leave them alone."
 MOS_civil_war.13.t: "Ivan Mozhaysky's Rebellion is Crushed"
 MOS_civil_war.13.d: "After the flight of Ivan of Mozhaisk to Lithuania, we are now in a position to seize the principality of Mozhaisk for ourself and increase $MONARCH$'s standing greatly. However, the boyars have not forgotten the decades-old practice of appointing the $MONARCHTITLE$'s younger brother as prince of Mozhaisk. Either way, no one is left to oppose $MONARCH$, putting an end to the Muscovite Civil War."
 MOS_civil_war.13.a: "Annex the principality of Mozhaisk."
 MOS_civil_war.13.b: "Appoint our younger brother for the position."
 MOS_civil_war.15.t: "Question of Qasim Sovereignty"
 MOS_civil_war.15.d: "Despite the Qasim Khanate being governed by Khans, the Muscovites have begun to interfere more and more in the affairs of the Khanate to the point where internal politics are controlled from Moscow. With Kazan seemingly in no state to oppose our de jure control, we can propose that we take over as overlords of Qasim, albeit with something to give them in return."
 MOS_civil_war.15.a: "Seize the opportunity to take control of the Khanate!"
 MOS_civil_war.15.a.tt: "We will present Kazan with a proposal to vassalise the Qasim Khanate for §Y100§! ducats."
 MOS_civil_war.15.b: "Drop the matter."
 MOS_civil_war.16.t: "Question of Qasim Sovereignty"
 MOS_civil_war.16.d: "Even though Muscovy acknowledged our rule over the Khanate of Qasim some years ago, it seems that they are still attempting to gain influence in their court. Today a Muscovite delegation presented us with a proposal - hand control of the Qasim Khanate over in exchange for an adequate sum of gold. Depending on our situation this may bring long-term benefits, so long as the Muscovites do not later use it to their advantage..."
 MOS_civil_war.16.a: "The gold is probably worth more than the Khanate..."
 MOS_civil_war.16.a.tt: "Muscovy will acquire the Khanate of Qasim for §Y100§! ducats."
 MOS_civil_war.16.b: "We cannot allow the Muscovites to interfere in the affairs of Qasim!"
 MOS_civil_war.16.b.tt: "Muscovy will receive news of their proposal being declined."
 MOS_civil_war.17.t: "Muscovy Acquires the Qasim Khanate"
 MOS_civil_war.17.d: "We have successfully convinced the Khan of Kazan that we are the true overlords of Qasim. Control shifted peacefully - that is, except for a group of Tatar serfs who would rather be ruled by their own kind."
 MOS_civil_war.17.a: "Qasim returns to the fold once more."
 MOS_civil_war.18.t: "Kazan Refuses Our Proposal"
 MOS_civil_war.18.d: "Despite our best efforts, the Khan of Kazan was not swayed by a bag of gold, instead demanding that the Muscovite governors be expelled from the Qasim Khanate. This has complicated our attempts to recover Kasimov, as well as relations with the two Khanates for the time being."
 MOS_civil_war.18.a: "Maybe next time, Tatars..."
 MOS_KAZ_WAR_NAME: "$ORDER$$FIRST$-$SECOND$ War"
 cb_muscovite_kazani_war: "Muscovite-Kazani War"
 cb_muscovite_kazani_war_desc: "The time has come to remind Muscovy of its status as a tributary to the Tatars!"
 MOS_civil_war_confiscated_holdings: "Confiscated Noble Holdings - §Y$VAL$%§!"
 MOS_civil_war.100.t: "End of the Muscovite Civil War"
 MOS_civil_war.100.d: "The Muscovite Civil War has ended, and Muscovy is left in ruins. Nonetheless, the political implications of this vast and desperate conflict will last for years to come. The Russian lands have changed, forever."
 MOS_civil_war.100.a: "Indeed."
