 albania.1.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta"
 albania.1.d: "Signed on March 26, 1451 between Alfonso V of the Kingdoms of Naples and Aragon and the ambassadors of Skanderbeg, the Treaty of Gaeta stipulated that Skanderbeg would recognize the suzerainty of Aragon, in return for support against the Ottoman Empire. Alfonso V aimed to restore Neapolitan influence in Albania, which had disappeared with the fall of the Angevin Kingdom of Albania. However, Albania never truly came under Alfonso's suzerainty, because Skanderbeg declined to fully recognize Alfonso's overlordship until the Ottoman threat was gone, a condition which was never fulfilled in his lifetime. \n\nShould we propose to the Albanians a treaty that could prospectively make them our vassals?"
 albania.1.a: "Yes, send diplomats to make this offer."
 albania.1.b: "No, it is unnecessary to our interests."
 albania.2.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta"
 albania.2.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us diplomats proposing that we accept an alliance with their country, to protect ourselves from the Ottomans. We would get men and arms to assist in the defense of our country, but this would come under the condition that we become vassals of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as soon as the Ottoman threat has left Albania. It is true that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a powerful country whose help might save us from Turkish tyranny. \n\nHow should we respond?"
 albania.2.a: "Accept the terms of this treaty - we can take no chances with the Ottomans."
 albania.2.b: "We do not need help from foreigners."

 albania.5.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta"
 albania.5.d: "Now that the Ottoman forces have been driven out of Albania, we must reconsider the Treaty of Gaeta and our obligations to those who helped us during those hard years of war. Should we fulfill our obligations of vassalage?"

 albania.7.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta Dishonored"
 albania.7.d: "The treacherous Albanians have refused to honor the Treaty of Gaeta, telling our diplomats that they will live under neither our own nor Ottoman rule. They scoff at the treaty they signed many years ago. Nonetheless, we can force them to recognize our overlordship."
