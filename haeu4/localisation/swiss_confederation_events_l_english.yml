 swiss_confederation.3.t: "Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire"
 swiss_confederation.3.d: "For centuries, Switzerland has been a part of the Holy Roman Empire, and many of its rural and urban territories enjoyed imperial immediacy in answering directly to the emperor. However, in the time since Switzerland became a part of the Empire, Imperial control over Italy has been lost, and the Swiss people have begun to forge a new national identity. In these changing times, it may be more fitting to find an independent path for the Republic of the Swiss."
 swiss_confederation.3.a: "We have no interest in the Empire."
 swiss_confederation.3.b: "We are an important part of the Empire."
 switzerland_left_empire: "Left the Empire"
 switzerland_in_empire: "Remained in the Empire"
 swiss_confederation.4.t: "Switzerland Leaves the Empire"
 swiss_confederation.4.d: "Although the Alpine territories of Switzerland were a part of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries, Imperial influence there has waned, as the country's independently minded communes have begun to disregard the Empire as a source of protection. Instead, the people of Switzerland now look to each other for the establishment of a mutual defense, and claim to have developed a new national identity. As a result, the Swiss declare that they are no longer subjects of the Holy Roman Empire."
 swiss_confederation.4.a: "Unsettling."
 swiss_confederation.5.t: "Switzerland Remains in the Empire"
 swiss_confederation.5.d: "The Alpine territories of Swtizerland were a part of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries. Nonetheless, with the waning of Imperial influence in Italy, the citizens of Switzerland began to openly discuss the potential for their independence from the Holy Roman Empire, citing the strength and reliability of their alliance compared to the protection provided by the Emperor. However, acknowledging the gravity of foreign threats, the leadership of Switzerland has ultimately decided that it is wiser to remain within the Holy Roman Empire, warning of an uncertain future if their country is to leave its boundaries."
 swiss_confederation.5.a: "A judicious choice."
 swiss_confederation.6.t: "The Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs"
 swiss_confederation.6.d: "On August 26, 1444, Swiss and French forces fought at the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs, one of the most consequential battles of the Old Zürich War, in which the canton of Zürich fought against its allies in the Old Swiss Confederacy in its bid to claim the lands of the Count of Toggenburg. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, who supported Zürich and opposed the growing might of the Old Swiss Confederacy, plead for French intervention, and so the Kingdom of France sent an army of 30,000 against the Swiss. Although the Swiss forces were outnumbered perhaps 10 to 1 by the French, the Swiss inflicted such devastating losses upon French forces that Louis, the Dauphin of France, declined to continue the intervention. Over the next several decades, Swiss forces would continue to dominate the battlefield through their extremely mobile pike formations, achieving legendary victories like that at the Battle of Nancy, where the Duke of Burgundy was killed, and the Battle of Novara, where the Swiss installed a puppet ruler over the Duchy of Milan. Not even the Holy Roman Emperor could bring Switzerland to its knees during the Swabian War, after which the Confederacy fell away from the sphere of the Holy Roman Empire. Only the implementation of more effective gunpowder weapons would bring about an end to the murderous effectiveness of the Swiss pike formations."
 swiss_confederation.6.a: "For the Confederacy!"
 swiss_prussia: "Swiss Pikes"
 desc_swiss_prussia: "The Swiss were renowned throughout the 15th and 16th centuries for the murderous effectiveness of their pike formations, which were organized into extremely mobile and disciplined units of 100 men."
