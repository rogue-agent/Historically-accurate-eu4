However, the Habsburgs, who had inherited the Low Countries, still laid claim to these provinces. In 1493, King Charles VIII of France signed the Treaty of Senlis, ceding these provinces to the Habsburgs in return for more freedom to interfere in Italian affairs. \n\nIt is possible for us to negotiate with France for the cession of some of the Burgundian provinces, but this comes with the risk that France will direct its aggressive foreign policy elsewhere.

In the aftermath, the city of Milan was thrown into extreme turmoil and confusion as multiple claimants jockeyed for control of the throne, of which two found the most support among the city's inhabitants, Francesco Sforza and Alfons V of Aragon. Alfons V had been designated heir to the Duchy one day before Duke Filippo Maria Visconti's death, and found support from some of the Milanese nobility. Although Sforza was not the ruler of great kingdom like Alfons, he garnered backing from his marriage to Bianca Maria Visconti, the Duke's illegitimate daughter. But while Alfons and Francesco battled for control of the throne, others in the city supported a third option - the foundation of a Milanese republic, based on the tenets of the old one.\nLearned bodies, such as the College of Jurisprudence in Pavia, painted the days of the old republic as a golden age. The merchants, viewing the prosperity of republican Venice, were behind the idea. Consequently, a republic was declared, and the claimants to the throne driven out of the city. The new republic was named the Golden Ambrosian Republic, after the 4th-century Bishop of Milan.\nIn these troubling times, we must decide who is to govern the future of Milan, to guide us through dark times ahead.
