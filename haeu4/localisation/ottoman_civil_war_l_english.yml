 ottoman_civil_war.1.t: "The Ottoman Civil War Begins"
 ottoman_civil_war.1.d: "For years, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has served dutifully as the ruler of the Ottoman Empire, governing dutifully and defending the country from all foes. However, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has grown old and weary, and common doubts regarding the effectiveness of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s' rule have raised questions regarding the succession among his sons. Although the Janissaries seem to still largely support $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, his ambitious sons could wreak havoc and chaos at any moment. The Ottoman Civil War has begun."
 ottoman_civil_war.1.a: "Unnerving..."
 ottoman_civil_war.1.a.tooltip: "The sons of the Sultan will likely revolt to take the Ottoman throne for themselves. If they take Constantinople, they will instantly take over the Ottoman Empire, and you will lose the game. Occupying the capital of any of the rebellious sons after one year of fighting will result in the reabsorption of their lands into the empire, which is necessary to end the disaster."
 dishonorable_surrender: "Dishonorable Surrender"
 dishonorable_surrender_desc: "Our surrender to one of the quarreling brothers for the Ottoman throne has been viewed as utterly dishonorable by the Janissary corps, who disapprove of the new Sultan. They are now leaving our ranks, and joining those of the other brothers plotting to bring about our downfall."
 ottoman_civil_war.2.t: "The Ambition of Ahmed"
 ottoman_civil_war.2.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s son Ahmed has long ruled Amasya, a city which has traditionally been handed down to potential Osmanoglu heirs in order to prepare them for governance upon taking the throne. However, Ahmed has now grown ambitious and troublesome, questioning the rule of his father and wishing to become Sultan himself. Although Ahmed could be appeased if we let him return to Constantinople and take over rulership of the empire, the Janissaries would be likely to resist him and not view him as a legitimate Ottoman ruler."
 ottoman_civil_war.2.a: "We will crush Ahmed!"
 ottoman_civil_war.2.b: "Negotiate with Ahmed and allow him to take the throne."
 ottoman_civil_war.3.t: "The Ambition of Selim"
 ottoman_civil_war.3.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s son Selim has long ruled in Rumelia, after having asked to be relocated there in order to be closer to the seat of the empire at Constantinople. However, Selim has now grown troublesome, weary of his father's relations with his brothers Ahmed and Korkut, suspicious of their ambitions with regard to the Ottoman throne. Although Selim could be appeased if we let him return to Constantinople and take over rulership of the empire, abdicating so easily to a rebellious son would not reflect well upon the Ottoman Sultanate."
 ottoman_civil_war.3.a: "We will crush Selim!"
 ottoman_civil_war.3.b: "Negotiate with Selim and allow him to take the throne."
 ottoman_civil_war.4.t: "The Ambition of Korkut"
 ottoman_civil_war.4.d: "Although he was never quite as ambitious as his brothers Ahmed and Selim, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s son Korkut, the governor of Antalya, has viewed the proceeding civil war for control of the empire with interest, and has now decided that it would best for him too to make his bid for the Ottoman throne. However, Korkut's claim for the Ottoman throne is by far the weakest among the brothers, and he also has control of the smallest domain among the three, in western Anatolia. Nonetheless, given the raging civil war, it perhaps would be beneficial to appease Korkut."
 ottoman_civil_war.4.a: "We will crush Korkut!"
 ottoman_civil_war.4.b: "Negotiate with Korkut and allow him to take the throne."
 ottoman_civil_war.5.t: "Ahmed Offers Peace"
 ottoman_civil_war.5.d: "Ahmed, the governor of Rûm, has grown weary of the continuing war for the Ottoman throne, and moreover is fearful of the ambitions of his brothers. Ahmed promises that if he takes the Ottoman throne, he will not only allow $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to go free and live unscathed, but also will defeat the other rebellious brothers on his behalf. Making peace with Ahmed could allow us to rapidly eliminate the others making claims to the Ottoman throne, and return peace to the empire."

Making peace with Selim could allow us to rapidly eliminate the others making claims to the Ottoman throne, and return peace to the empire.\nSelim is notably more gifted than his brothers, so this is an offer we should take seriously, as the Janissaries specifically approve of Selim, but none of his siblings."
 ottoman_civil_war.6.a: "Let us make peace with Selim."
 ottoman_civil_war.6.b: "Selim is unworthy of being Sultan!"
 ottoman_civil_war.7.t: "Korkut Offers Peace"
