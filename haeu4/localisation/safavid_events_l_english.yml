 desc_rise_of_safavids: "The ascent of Joneid Safavi to the leadership of Ardabil has permanently changed the character of the Safaviyya from a purely religious order, transforming it into a militaristic organization bent on territorial expansion and conquest."

 desc_qizilbash_support: "The Qizilbash, a Shia militant group of Azerbaijan, Anatolia, and Kurdistan, has agreed to support us in warfare against our enemies."
 safavid.1.t: "The Rise of Joneid"
 safavid.1.d: "Originally, the Safaviyya were a Sufi religious order following the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam. However, in 1447, the leadership of the Safaviyya was taken over by Sheikh Joneid, who became the first leader of the order to espouse Shia teachings. From then on, the Safaviyya order would become tied to Twelverism and lead jihads into neighboring heathen lands.\nJoneid Safavi has arrived in Ardabil announcing his intent to spread the teachings of Shia Islam far and wide, promising many conquests in the name of the faith. He has the support of many loyal followers who swear that they will fight in his name. How should we regard his proposition?"
 safavid.1.a: "Allow Joneid to become leader of the Safaviyya."
 safavid.1.a.tooltip: "Ardabil and all the Sunni provinces it owns will be converted to Shia. We will be able to choose a new religious school."
 safavid.1.b: "We reject this heresy!"
 safavid.2.t: "A Son of Joneid"
 safavid.2.d: "In 1459, Sheikh Joneid died in a skirmish with the forces of the Shirvanshah, having been prevented from returning to Ardabil by the Qara Qoyunlu. At the time, Joneid's son Haidar was only an infant, but nonetheless, Haidar would grow up to become just as amibitious as his father. In 1469, Haidar's uncle Uzun Hasan, ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu, installed Haidar as the ruler of Ardabil, from where he would conduct further military campaigns.\nHaidar has arrived in Ardabil, supported by many members of the Qizilbash, a Shia military order of Azerbaijan. Should we allow him to become our leader?"
 safavid.2.a: "Sheikh Haidar will be an excellent leader for Ardabil."
 safavid.2.b: "Ignore his rabble."
 safavid.3.t: "A Son of Haidar"
 safavid.3.d: "Although Sheikh Haidar was a brilliant general, he eventually found himself in conflict with his former patron, Aq Qoyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan. Despite fighting bravely, Sheikh Haidar was subsequently trapped in a pitched battle and slain by Hasan's troops. Although Soltan-Ali Safavi would succeed his father Haidar, he too was slain by Aq Qoyunlu troops, leaving behind only his younger brother, Ismâ'îl. Ismâ'îl, wrought with grief and rage, pledged to avenge the killings of his family members. As a result, Ismâ'îl followed the steps of his ancestors, winning the support of the Qizilbash and other allies and mustering an army for the upcoming war with the Shirvanshahs and the Aq Qoyunlu. In the resulting conflict, Ismâ'îl would emerge victorious, going on to found one of the greatest empires in Persian history, the Safavid Empire.\nAn angry Ismâ'îl, enraged by the deaths of his predecessors, has arrived in Ardabil. He promises to end the threat posed by Ardabil's foes once and for all, replacing their dominions with a new and almighty Persian empire. Should we support him?"
 safavid.3.a: "He clearly has the potential to be a gifted ruler."
 safavid.3.b: "His anger is misplaced."
 safavid.4.t: "The Emergence of the Qizilbash"
 safavid.4.d: "The Qizilbash were a Turkic Shia militant group from Azerbaijan, Anatolia, and Kurdistan that flourished from the late 15th century onward. They would become one of the most important contributors to the foundation of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, lending their troops toward the conquests of Persia, opposing all of the Safavid's Sunni enemies.\nNow that Ardabil is at war, the Qizilbash have pledged their support to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ until victory is achieved in the coming conflict. They promise that they will staunchly support us on the battlefield."
 safavid.4.a: "We are thankful for their aid."
 safavid.4.a.tooltip: "The forces of the Qizilbash will aid us in fighting our enemies until war has concluded."
 safavid.5.t: "The Qizilbash Return to Peace"
 safavid.5.d: "Now that the conflicts of Ardabil have ended, the Qizilbash have returned to their homes, promising that they will return should we find ourselves in trouble once again."
 safavid.5.a: "We wish them the best."
 safavid.6.t: "The Ambitions of Pirbudag"
 safavid.6.d: "Pirbudag, the son of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, has chafed at the rule of his father, wanting even greater power and autonomy for himself. As a result, unless Pirbudag is given a position of power somewhere within the realm of the Qara Qoyunlu, it is inevitable that he will lead a revolt against $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. To alleviate this threat, we could offer Pirbudag the rulership of the city of Baghdad."
 safavid.6.a: "Let Pirbudag rule in Baghdad."
 safavid.6.b: "I will not tolerate insolent children."
 safavid.7.t: "Uzun Hasan in the Armies"
 safavid.7.d: "The heir to the leadership of the Aq Qoynulu, Uzun Hasan, has expressed his willingness to fight in and lead our armies, citing the dangers of the Ottomans to our west and the Qara Qoyunlu to our east. Should he be allowed to serve, Uzun Hasan would be an extremely gifted general, but we would be risking his life by allowing him onto the battlefield."
 safavid.7.a: "Allow Uzun Hasan to lead the armies."
 safavid.7.b: "There is no need for him to endanger himself."
 safavid.8.t: "The Threat of the Aq Qoyunlu"
 safavid.8.d: "The Aq Qoyunlu were a Turkic tribal confederation that had long rivaled the Qara Qoyunlu. After the campaigns of Timur, the Aq Qoyunlu were allowed to rule over the city of Diyarbakir, expanding their domains greatly at the expense of the Qara Qoyunlu. Recently, the Aq Qoyunlu appointed the ambitious and capable Uzun Hasan to lead their armies, and he has promised to bring about the demise of the Qara Qoyunlu. Although we have generally held the upper hand in our conflicts with the Aq Qoyunlu, Uzun Hasan's rhetoric endangers the long-term stability of our realm."
 safavid.8.a: "Let us teach the Aq Qoyunlu a valuable lesson in respect."
 safavid.8.b: "Why should we concern ourselves with lesser nations?"

 safavid.9.d: "After many years of triumphant warfare, the Persian state has ascended to become a dominant force in the politics of the Middle East. Other states, no matter how mighty or warlike, will now have to respect us as a dominant Middle Eastern power."

 safavid.10.t: "Pirbudag Claims the Throne"
 safavid.10.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s son Pirbudag, who had been discontented with his previous role within the government and was thus given authority over Baghdad, is now allegedly looking to depose $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ as ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu! Already, Pirbudag is looking for supporters from far and wide to back his planned revolt, and if he is not dealt with, there could be dire consequences."
 safavid.10.a: "The audacity!"
 safavid.11.t: "The Arrival of Pirbudag"
 safavid.11.d: "The leader of the Qara Qoyunlu has deposed the governor of Baghdad and established his son Pirbudag as the new ruler of the city, allegedly because Pirbudag has become unruly and difficult to handle. By leaving Pirbudag to his on devices in Baghdad, the Qara Qoyunlu leadership hopes that they can be rid of the trouble that he has threatened to bring to their country."
 safavid.11.a: "He is hardly welcome here, either."
 safavid.12.t: "Pirbudag's Ambition"
 safavid.12.d: "After having taken over the city of Baghdad, Pirbudag has allegedly been plotting for some time now to seize the throne of the Qara Qoyunlu for himself. Now his machinations are finally in the open, and Pirbudag has made official his claim to the rulership of the Qara Qoyunlu, looking for allies far and wide who will back his claim. It seems that this is the perfect opportunity for overcoming the Qara Qoyunlu."
 safavid.12.a: "Pirbudag is a bold ruler indeed."

However, should the Qara Qoyunlu be weak at the time of Jahân's death, it is likely that the many vassals of the decentralized Qara Qoyunlu empire will rise up and form new domains of their own."
 safavid.13.t: "Death of Shah Rukh"
 safavid.13.d: "Although we have been free from Timurid domination for some time now, the recent death of Timurid Sultan Shah Rukh has reconfirmed our independence in the lands west of Persia. However, now that Shah Rukh is dead, we no longer need to limit ourselves from expansion further east..."
 safavid.13.a: "The Black Sheep will fall upon Persia!"
 safavid.14.t: "Death of Shah Rukh"
 safavid.14.d: "To the south, the formerly great Timurid Sultan Shah Rukh has died. Although he formerly ruled the Timurid lands with an iron fist, now that he has perished, the Timurid princes show signs of ambition, and even unease. It is clear that the status quo in the Timurid lands will no longer continue, and that the empire is about to fall apart. In this tumultuous time, perhaps we can move south and take the former Timurid capital at Samarqand..."
 safavid.14.a: "The Uzbeks will fall upon Persia!"
 safavid.15.t: "A Southern Capital"
 safavid.15.d: "In 1428, Chimgi-Tura was named the capital of the Uzbek Khanate following the conquest of western Siberia. However, our southern conquests have put us in a prime position to raid the civilized lands to the south, and as a result it may be wise to move our capital south from Chimgi-Tura to Syghnak."
 safavid.15.a: "Let us move the capital!"
 safavid.15.b: "The lands of Siberia are too important."
 safavid.16.t: "The Sibir Khanate"
 safavid.16.d: "Ever since we moved our capital south to Syghnak, our influence over the people of Siberia has declined. Unless we take action, it is possible that the people of Siberia will separate from us entirely, forming a new Muslim khanate to the far north."
 safavid.16.a: "Allow Sibir to be free."
 safavid.16.b: "They are a part of our empire!"
 safavid.17.t: "The Kazakh Revolt"
 safavid.17.d: "In 1459, several Uzbek tribes displeased with the rule of Khan Abu'l-Khayr fled the Uzbek lands in the Great Migration, settling in Moghulistan and establishing an independent state there. While this created a buffer between the Uzbeks and Moghulistan, the Uzbeks would eventually invade, resulting in a decades-long war for the control of the steppe. In 1500, the Uzbeks finally admitted defeat, ceding all lands north of the Syr Darya River to the nascent Kazakh Khanate.\nProtesting the ineffective rule of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, a group of tribesmen to our north have risen up against us. How should we handle the situation?"

 desc_the_ruin_of_georgia: "After decades of invasion by the Timurids and then the Qara Qoyunlu, the lands of Georgia have entered a steep decline. Although we have maintained our independence, it has come at great cost, and it will take many years for our country to heal its vicious wounds."
 safavid.18.t: "The Decline of Georgia"
 safavid.18.d: "The Kingdom of Georgia was once the center of a great Caucasian empire stretching from the Black Sea to the Caspian, with even more people than the Kingdom of England. However, the rise of Timur began a turn in the fortunes of the mighty Georgian people, who endured endless massacres, sackings, and invasions at the hands of his armies. After the death of Timur, the turmoil did not relent, as the Qara Qoyunlu invaded the lands of Georgia next, continuing to pursue reckless violence. Hundreds of thousands of Georgians have died or fled in the ensuing carnage. Furthermore, the country has fragmented into multiple bickering states, with no unity in sight as the Bagrationi dynasty has reached the nadir of its power.\nEven in the last few years, the Kingdom of Georgia was embroiled in yet another brutal conflict with the Qara Qoyunlu, in which Tbilisi was sacked and thousands more lives were lost. If things do not change, this may be the end of Georgia and its people."
