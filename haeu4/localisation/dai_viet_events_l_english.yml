 dai_viet.1.t: "Nam Tiên"
 dai_viet.1.d: "From the 11th to mid-18th century, the Vietnamese ethnic group gradually expanded south in what became known as \"Nam Tiên,\" or the \"March to the South.\" Warring first against the Chams and then the Khmers, the Vietnamese tripled the size of their country, settling modern South Vietnam and the Mekong Delta with countless Vietnamese settlers, while displacing and forcibly assimilating native populations all over the coast. In what could possibly be described in modern terms as a genocide, the Cham culture and state were practically extinguished, while Cambodians to this day still hold grudges against the historical expansionism of the Vietnamese state."
 dai_viet.1.a: "But the march south goes on."
 dai_viet.8.t: "The Mac Rebellion"
 dai_viet.8.d: "At the beginnng of the 16th century, Dai Viêt was governed by a series of increasingly ineffective, cruel, and indulgent rulers, who became increasingly reviled by the nobles and the populace for their debauchery and malevolence. Amid this turmoil, Mac Dang Dung, formerly the bodyguard to one of these emperors, led a rebellion against the Lê in 1520, causing a civil war and murdering the Emperor of Dai Viêt in 1526. In the ensuing chaos, a new dynasty would be founded in northern Vietnam, the Mac Dynasty, which would fight with the Lê Dynasty for many decades before being finally destroyed in 1677.\nA warlord of the Mac family has risen up in the north, proclaiming Dong Kinh as his capital. It is time to answer his claims to the throne of Vietnam."
 dai_viet.8.a: "We will vanquish the Mac!"
 vietnamese_warlord_era: "Warlord Era"
 desc_vietnamese_warlord_era: "Dai Viêt has fractured into warring factions, who now all jockey for the domination of Vietnam. As a result, the legitimacy of our dynasty has practically disintegrated. We can only prove our claim to the Mandate of Heaven by destroying the pretenders."
 dai_viet.9.t: "The Nguyên Lords"
 dai_viet.9.d: "Although they were allied with the Trinh lords of Dai Viêt in their war against the Mac, the Nguyên lords, who governed the southernmost reaches of Vietnam, gained increasing autonomy and independence throughout the era, eventually proclaiming themselves as the Nguyên Lords. The Nguyên were effectively independent dynasts of the south, and would govern it for more than two centuries, even undertaking conquests against Champa and the Khmer while also fighting with the Trinh lords for control of all Vietnam.\nAware that we have been distracted by the war with the Mac, the Nguyên look to gain independence from our rule. Even though they will still assist us in the struggle against Mac domination, if we do not accede to their demands, they may become our enemies as well."
 dai_viet.9.a: "Let us negotiate with the Nguyên."
 dai_viet.9.b: "Dai Viêt must remain united!"
 dai_viet.10.t: "The Decline of the Mac"
 dai_viet.10.d: "To our south, the Vietnamese have been embroiled in a ruthless civil war, fighting against the insurgent Mac family, which has claimed rulership to all Vietnam. We have long tried, and failed, to exert permanent direct Chinese influence over Vietnam, having been defeated by the Vietnamese in battle many times. However, fomenting the division of Dai Viêt could weaken the Vietnamese and make them more malleable to our demands."
 dai_viet.10.a: "We should support Mac independence."
 dai_viet.10.b: "There is nothing good in the wars of Vietnam."
 dai_viet.11.t: "The Ming Defend the Mac Dynasty"
 dai_viet.11.d: "Sensing our predicament in the war for the throne of Vietnam, the Ming have decided to intervene on our behalf by protecting what remains of our realm. This has further legitimized the claim of the Mac to Vietnam, and perhaps we will be able to make an attempt for the throne once again."
 dai_viet.11.a: "Good news in trying times."
 grateful_for_protection: "Grateful for Protection"
 dai_viet.12.t: "The Ming Defend the Mac Dynasty"
 dai_viet.12.d: "In a grave diplomatic insult to Dai Viêt, the Ming have announced their intention to protect the Mac pretenders! The Mac have now been legitimized by the Ming, and this has weakened our claim to the throne of Vietnam."
 dai_viet.12.a: "Idiots!"
 resentful_of_interference: "Resentful of Interference"
 dai_viet.13.t: "The Fall of the Mac"
 dai_viet.13.d: "At long last, we have vanquished the so-called Mac Dynasty, and their claim to the throne of Vietnam. The country is united once again, and we no longer need to suffer the claims of pretenders to our titles."
 dai_viet.13.a: "A long-awaited victory."
 dai_viet.14.t: "The Rise of the Trinh Lords"
 dai_viet.14.d: "Throughout the Vietnamese civil war era, the Emperors of Dai Viêt were practically reduced to the status of figureheads. During this time, the Trinh lords began to take increasing control of the country and its administration, becoming the de facto rulers of Vietnam.\nThe Emperor is current weak and incapable of ruling the country effectively. Should we cede rule of the country to the ambitious Trinh lords?"
 dai_viet.14.a: "Allow the Trinh lords to take over."
 dai_viet.14.b: "There will be no more pretenders!"
 dai_viet.15.t: "The Question of the Nguyên Lords"
 dai_viet.15.d: "Now that the Mac have been defeated, it is time to reconsider the autonomy of the Nguyên lords, who took advantage of the war's turmoil in order to carve out an independent realm for themselves. We can demand that the Nguyên lords once again submit to the rule of our dynasty."
 dai_viet.15.a: "Vietnam must be reunited!"
 dai_viet.15.b: "The current situation is fine."
 dai_viet.16.t: "The Demands of Dai Viêt"
 dai_viet.16.d: "The Vietnamese Emperor has demanded that we submit once again to his rule now that the Mac Dynasty has been defeated. Despite the fall of the Mac though, it remains questionable whether the Emperor even has the power to make us submit - or even stop us from taking his throne."
 dai_viet.16.a: "Let us rejoin Dai Viêt."
 dai_viet.16.b: "We are the new rulers of Vietnam!"
 dai_viet.17.t: "The Nguyên Lords Submit"
 dai_viet.17.d: "The Nguyên lords of the south have agreed to finally rejoin our country, and submit themselves to the rule of the Emperor. They have been loyal servants during the last several years of war, and should be treated well as a result."
 dai_viet.17.a: "What honorable people."
 dai_viet.18.t: "The Nguyên Lords Claim the Throne"
 dai_viet.18.d: "Although we demanded that they submit themselves to the rule of the Emperor, the Nguyên lords have now refused to submit, and instead laid claim to all Vietnam! Our old allies in the south have made it clear that there will soon be war, and it seems that the internal wars of Vietnam have not ended yet."
 dai_viet.18.a: "The rebellious fools!"
 resisting_the_mac: "Resisting the Mac"
 dai_viet.19.t: "The Empress Dowager"
 dai_viet.19.d: "The previous emperor of Dai Viêt, Lê Thái Tông, died in 1442. While he left an heir in the young prince Lê Bang Co, he is only three years old now, and thus has been too young to rule. As a result, young Empress Nguyên Thi Anh has taken up the role of Lê Bang Co's regent, governing in the stead of her son. However, the nobles of the realm are deeply suspicious of Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh, and are potentially conspiring to bring about the end of her rule. The times are unstable and troubling for Dai Viêt."
 dai_viet.19.a: "Unnerving."
 the_empress_dowager: "The Empress Dowager"
 desc_the_empress_dowager: "Dai Viêt is currently ruled by the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh, who is serving as regent for her son Lê Bang Co. The nobles despise Nguyên Thi Anh's cruelty, and violence could erupt in Dai Viêt at any moment."
 dai_viet.19.a.tooltip: "If the young prince Lê Bang Co is disinherited or dies early, there will be extreme turmoil and chaos in the lands of Dai Viêt."
 dai_viet.20.t: "The Death of Lê Bang Co"
 dai_viet.20.d: "Emperor Lê Bang Co has died. While Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh has been ruling in his stead, this situation cannot go on forever, and there is another fitting prince of the Lê dynasty who can take the throne. Lê Tu Thành is a highly educated and gifted young man, and has expressed deep ambitions about restructuring the government of Dai Viêt and transforming the country along Confucian ideas into a respected and powerful nation. Should we allow him to take power, the country will benefit greatly."
 dai_viet.20.a: "We welcome Lê Tu Thành!"
 dai_viet.20.b: "This is the end of the Lê!"
 dai_viet.21.t: "The Plot Against the Empress Dowager"
 dai_viet.21.d: "For a long time, the nobility has chafed under the grating and cruel rule of Empress Nguyên Thi Anh. They tire of her domination of the country, saying that it cannot be ruled by a woman so petulant. Lê Nghi Dân, the brother of the prince Lê Bang Co, decided to side with the rebellious nobles and stage a coup!\nLê Nghi Dân's forces stormed the palace grounds, capturing the Empress Dowager and her son. Empress Nguyên Thi Anh, knowing that she was doomed to be executed, had a loyal servant kill her shortly thereafter. Her son was brutally murdered by Lê Nghi Dân's troops, who have made Nghi Dân the new Emperor of Dai Viêt."
 dai_viet.21.a: "The horror!"
 dai_viet.22.t: "The Plot Against Lê Nghi Dân"
 dai_viet.22.d: "For some time now, Lê Nghi Dân has ruled as the Emperor of Dai Viêt, following the murder of his brother and the assisted suicide of his aunt, the late Empress Dowager. However, the people of Dai Viêt have been uneasy and angry at the sudden turn of events, greatly displeased at being ruled by a malevolent monarch who has committed the crime of fratricide. Moreover, the nobles have become greatly alarmed at Nghi Dân's continued cruelty. They are now supporting Lê Tu Thành as a contender for the Vietnamese throne. Should we support this aspiring prince, the brother of Lê Nghi Dân?"
 dai_viet.22.a: "We cannot allow a murderer to rule Dai Viêt!"
 dai_viet.22.b: "Lê Tu Thành must die!"
 dai_viet.23.t: "The Death of Lê Bang Co"
 dai_viet.23.d: "Lê Bang Co is no longer the Emperor of Dai Viêt, and his mother, the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh continues to rule. However, now that her son is dead, there is no legitimate pretense for her to maintain power over the country. The nobles now support Lê Nghi Dân, the brother of the deceased prince Lê Bang Co, as the Emperor of Dai Viêt. Should the Empress Dowager step down and allow Lê Nghi Dân and his supporters to take over the country?"
 dai_viet.23.a: "Let us step down."
 dai_viet.23.b: "This is the end of the Lê!"
 dai_viet.24.t: "The Cruelty of Nghi Dân"
 dai_viet.24.d: "Emperor Lê Nghi Dân has proven to be a more cruel ruler than the nobles who supported him could have ever imagined, executing political opponents and suspected enemies left and right. Already, the nobles tire of his brazen bloodthirst, and are now searching for an alternative prince to take the Vietnamese throne. Lê Tu Thành, the brother of Lê Nghi Dân, still lives, and could prove to be a highly capable ruler."
 dai_viet.24.a: "This is the end of Lê Nghi Dân."
 dai_viet.24.b: "Lê Tu Thành must die!"
 dai_viet.25.t: "Emperor Lê Bang Co Comes of Age"
 dai_viet.25.d: "For many years now, Dai Viêt has been governed by the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh. It would greatly please the nobility if she would finally step down and allow her adult son to truly take the throne of Dai Viêt."
 dai_viet.25.a: "My time as ruler has ended."

 dai_viet.26.t: "The Might of Esen Choros"
 dai_viet.26.d: "In the past decades, Khan Esen Choros of the Four Oirat has wreaked havoc across the Central Asian steppe, pillaging and conquering lands from Moghulistan in the west to Korea in the east. He has expressed an ambition to restore the glory of the tribes north of China, and potentially reestablish the dominance of the Yuan. While Esen's hold over the hordes is firm, should he die, it is extremely questionable whether the Oirat will be able to maintain their supremacy. Nonetheless, the hordes under Esen constitute the greatest unified threat that China has seen from the hordes in more than a century."
 dai_viet.26.a: "The Ming ought to fear us!"
 dai_viet.26.a.tooltip: "The tribes subject to Oirat will remain loyal until the death of Esen Choros. While the loyalty of the hordes is conditional for now, achieving a great victory over Ming China could inspire them to never leave our side..."

 dai_viet.31.d: "To the awe of all, the Four Oirat and its subject hordes led by Khan Esen Choros have brought the Ming to their knees after the capture of their emperor. It is now clear that the Oirat are destined to rule the steppes and become the founders of the next great horde empire. Following the defeat of Ming, all hordes now acknowledge the primacy of the Four Oirat."
