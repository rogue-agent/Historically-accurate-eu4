 borgia.1.t: "The Arrival of Cesare Borgia"
 borgia.1.d: "In 756, the Frankish king Pepin the Great, who had been campaigning in the lands of the Lombard Kingdom, made the Donation of Pepin to the nascent State of the Church. Through the Donation of Pepin, the Pope greatly expanded his temporal authority, gaining dominion over the Romagna, the Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, and the Pentapolis of the Adriatic Coast. In times since then however, many of these territories have broken away from papal control, and are now under the rule of petty sovereigns who only pay lip service to the authority of the Pope.\nRecently, a man by the name of Cesare Borgia mysteriously arrived in Rome from abroad. Reputedly a great statesman and military leader, Cesare Borgia is said to have led many mercenary armies to impressive victories as a seasoned condottiero, and is now in Rome to serve the Pope and the faith. According to a rumor though, he is supposedly some illegitimate relation of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$...\nWhatever Borgia's connections may be, he has expressed that he is more than willing to assist the Papal States in reacquiring control of the lands of central Italy. As long as we are willing to provide him with financial and military aid, he says, he will conquer these territories for the Papacy."
 borgia.1.a: "An interesting proposal. Provide him with money and men!"
 borgia.1.b: "We cannot aid his ventures as of now, but he would make an excellent advisor."
 borgia.2.t: "The Invasion of Cesare Borgia"
 borgia.2.d: "Cesare Borgia, a famed Italian condottiero, has invaded our lands! He is allegedly supported by the Pope, who apparently has ambitions regarding the fate of central Italy."
 borgia.2.a: "Curses!"
 borgia.3.t: "Cesare Borgia Conquers the Romagna"
 borgia.3.d: "It appears that we made the correct choice in aiding the exploits of Cesare Borgia. He has conquered the Romagna, and has transformed it into his personal duchy. Already his armies are once again on the move, looking forward to the conquest of additional lands in the region. He will be an important ally for the Papal States."
 borgia.3.a: "As ordained by God."
 borgia.4.t: "Cesare Borgia Conquers the Romagna"
 borgia.4.d: "Now that Romagna is under the rule of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, we are receiving support from the Pope, and are being encouraged to pursue further military exploits on his behalf. This is an extremely potent and unique opportunity for us to extend our control over the rest of Italy."
 borgia.4.a: "The Holy Father will be greatly pleased."
 borgia.5.t: "The Death of Cesare Borgia"
 borgia.5.d: "Cesare Borgia, the former Duke of Romagna is dead. He performed a great service by conquering the Papal States' enemies in Italy on our behalf. Now that he is dead however, it is time to consider the return of these lands to the Pope."
 borgia.5.a: "Seize the lands of Borgia."
 borgia.5.b: "Allow Cesare Borgia's successors to continue their rule."
 borgia.6.t: "The Pope Claims Romagna"
 borgia.6.d: "In the aftermath of the death of Cesare Borgia, the Pope, who has long been suspected of being Borgia's illegitimate father, has laid claim to all the conquests that Borgia made. The Pope demands that we turn over these lands to the Papal States, but if we do, we will lose our independence completely. What shall we do?"
 borgia.6.a: "Agree to the demands of the Holy Father."
 borgia.6.b: "These are forever the lands of Borgia!"
 borgia.7.t: "The Pope Permits Romagnan Independence"
 borgia.7.d: "In the aftermath of the death of Cesare Borgia, it was expected that the Pope, who has long been suspected of being Borgia's illegitimate father, would lay claim to all the conquests that Borgia made. However, in reality, the Pope has done no such thing, and instead has attested that he is fine with seeing the Romagna continue its independence. This will only further legitimize our rule of these territories."
 borgia.7.a: "The Holy Father is truly a wise man."
 borgia.8.t: "The Romagna Refuses to Submit"
 borgia.8.d: "Despite the demands of the Pope, the people of the Romagna have refused to submit to papal authority! This unexpected development could threaten our hold over central Italy, as the armies of the Romagna remain strong."
 borgia.8.a: "How ungrateful!"
 borgia.9.t: "The Election of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$"
 borgia.9.d: "Previously, the office of the papacy was held by the illegitimate father of Cesare Borgia, a condottiero who has gone on a rampage of conquest throughout central Italy on his behalf. However, with the death of the previous pope, who was long suspected of having been Borgia's illegitimate father, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has come to be the leader of the Papal States, and is said to be a rival of the powerful Borgia family. As a result, while $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has designs on the lands of central Italy, it is less likely that Cesare Borgia will be willing to deal with him. How should we proceed?"
 borgia.9.a: "Demand that Borgia cede his lands to the papacy."
 borgia.9.b: "Allow Cesare Borgia to continue his rule."
 borgia.9.c: "Demand Borgia's fealty to the papacy."
 borgia.10.t: "The Pope Demands the Fealty of Romagna"
 borgia.10.d: "The election of a new pope has boded ill for Cesare Borgia and his rule in the Romagna. The new pope is allegedly from the rival family of Cesare Borgia, and not willing to see the continued growth of Borgia power. Nonetheless, the Pope is willing to negotiate, and has asked that we simply codify our allegiance to the Papal States. What shall we do?"
 borgia.10.a: "Agree to the demands of the Holy Father."
 borgia.10.b: "These are forever the lands of Borgia!"
 borgia.11.t: "The Pope Permits Romagnan Independence"
 borgia.11.d: "It was originally thought that the election of a new pope boded ill for Cesare Borgia and his rule in the Romagna. The new pope is allegedly from the rival family of Cesare Borja, who was previously believed to be unwilling to see the continued growth of Borgia power. However, to our surprise, he has made no claim upon the lands of the Romagna, and attested that he is fine with seeing the Romagna continue its independence. This will only further legitimize our rule of these territories."

 borgia.12.t: "The Pope Claims Romagna"
 borgia.12.d: "The election of a new pope has boded ill for Cesare Borgia and his rule in the Romagna.

 borgia.15.t: "The Condottieri"
 borgia.15.d: "For almost all of the 15th century, warfare by the Italian city-states was conducted through condottieri, Italian mercenary captains who wielded vast multinational armies on the behalf of powerful sovereigns. The condottieri led practically the entire fighting forces of the Italian city-states, and were paid exorbitantly for their services. However, the beginning of the Italian wars and foreign intervention in peninsular affairs after 1490 led many of the condottieri to abandon the service of the Italian city-states, instead taking up contract with far greater powers like Spain and France."
