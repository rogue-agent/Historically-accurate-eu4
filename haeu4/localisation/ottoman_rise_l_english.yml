 ottoman_rise.1.t: "The Allegiance of Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.1.d: "Before the Battle of Varna, Wallachia was a subject of the Ottoman Empire, obligated to send troops and tribute in order to aid in the conquests of the Sultan. However, since the Battle of Varna, Wallachia has become a practically independent state teetering between the Hungarian and Ottoman spheres of influence, fearing invasion from one or the other. The time has come to deal with the difficult question of Wallachian allegiance."
 ottoman_rise.1.a: "Demand that the Wallachians pay homage."
 ottoman_rise.1.b: "We have no need for Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.2.t: "Demands from the Sublime Porte"
 ottoman_rise.2.d: "Before the Battle of Varna, Wallachia was a subject of the Ottoman Empire, obligated to send troops and tribute in order to aid in the conquests of the Sultan. However, since the Battle of Varna, Wallachia has become a practically independent state teetering between the Hungarian and Ottoman spheres of influence, fearing invasion from one or the other. It appears that the Ottomans have now sent a demand that we acknowledge them again as our suzerain, or risk the invasion and destruction of our country."
 ottoman_rise.2.a: "Very well, we will accede to their demands."
 ottoman_rise.2.b: "Impale their wretched ambassadors!"
 ottoman_rise.3.t: "Wallachia Submits!"
 ottoman_rise.3.d: "Wallachia has submitted to the authority of the Sultan once again, becoming a subject of the Ottoman Empire. It is to be hoped that there will be no more issues with their allegiance."
 ottoman_rise.3.a: "Excellent."
 ottoman_rise.4.t: "Ambassadors Impaled!"
 ottoman_rise.4.d: "The Voivode of Wallachia, enraged at our demands for suzerainty, ordered that the Ottoman diplomats be impaled and displayed their bodies outside his castle as a defiant sign of Wallachia's continued independence. It appears that if we are to take over Wallachia once again, we must resort to the use of force."
 ottoman_rise.4.a: "Uncivilized brutes!"
 ottoman_rise.5.t: "The Crisis of Moldavia"
 ottoman_rise.5.d: "For many years now, the Principality of Moldavia has been a state on the frontiers of two burgeoning realms, the Kingdom of Poland to the north and the Ottoman Empire to the south. These two fated enemies have clashed intermittently throughout the years, and much of the fighting has taken place on Moldavian soil. Despite their pledge to defend the lands of Moldavia from foreign invaders, the Ottomans have made headway into the country and conquered some of its provinces, spreading fear and terror far and wide.\nWith the Poles utterly incapable of stopping the Ottoman threat, some of the Moldavian nobles are now asking $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to abandon the Polish cause, and instead declare Moldavian suzerainty to the Ottoman Empire so that the country will no longer have to bear the brunt of the Ottoman invasions. With Poland so weak, they reason, it is better to fight them than the Ottomans.\nWe can negotiate with the Ottomans for their protection, but they may not necessarily accept our proposition. We will not be able to keep our negotiations secret from Poland, so if we do not manage to secure the suzerainty of the Ottomans, we will be left utterly defenseless."
 ottoman_rise.5.a: "A compelling suggestion. Let us try and join the Ottomans."
 ottoman_rise.5.b: "It is not worth the risk. We must stick together with Poland."
 ottoman_rise.6.t: "Moldavia Offers its Submission"
 ottoman_rise.6.d: "For many years now, the Principality of Moladvia, as a consequence of its suzerainty to Poland, has been ravaged by the troops of the Ottoman Empire. It appears that the conquest of some of the Moldavian lands and the weakness of Poland have led the Moldavian nobles to abandon Poland as an ally, for they now seek protection from us. While we could accept Moldavia as a subject, we may have to return some of their conquered lands to them in order to keep relations cordial."
 ottoman_rise.6.a: "Let us defend Moldavia from the Polish menace!"
 ottoman_rise.6.b: "We do not accept traitors."
 ottoman_rise.7.t: "The Moldavian Betrayal"
 ottoman_rise.7.d: "The Moldavian nobility, citing Poland's weakness in its conflicts against the Ottomans, have pledged their suzerainty to their empire and abandoned the Kingdom of Poland as an ally. This perfidy greatly threatens the security of the Polish state and now brings the Ottoman sphere of influence onto the very edge of our realm."
 ottoman_rise.7.a: "The fools! They will soon see the might of Poland."
 ottoman_rise.8.t: "A Venetian Queen of Cyprus"
 ottoman_rise.8.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is without a wife, and has sent dignitaries far and wide in search of one to accompany him in his rule. One potential candidate to be Queen of Cyprus is Catarina Corner, the daughter of a Venetian patrician. If we allow $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to wed Catarina, we could greatly improve our relations with the Republic of Venice. However, at the same time, arranging such a marriage could cause unforeseen complications regarding our political independence."
 ottoman_rise.8.a: "Let us take a Venetian bride."
 ottoman_rise.8.b: "We cannot trust the likes of Venice."
 ottoman_rise.9.t: "The Inheritance of Cyprus"
 ottoman_rise.9.d: "The death of the King of Cyprus has brought Venetian ambassadors... and warships. The Venetians claim that Catarina Corner has sold the island of Cyprus to their state, and that it is now a possession of the Republic. Whether Corner has done this willfully or was coerced is unknown, but whatever the case, the independence of our island is at stake."
 ottoman_rise.9.a: "Allow the Venetians to take over Cyprus."
 ottoman_rise.9.b: "Ward them off!"
 ottoman_rise.10.t: "The Inheritance of Cyprus"
 ottoman_rise.10.d: "Following the death of the last Cypriot king, his Venetian wife Catarina Corner bequeathed control of the island of Cyprus to us. We now have another foothold even deeper in the Eastern Mediterranean, from which we can continue to expand our control of regional commerce."
 ottoman_rise.10.a: "A generous gift!"
 ottoman_rise.11.t: "The Cypriots Declare Independence"
 ottoman_rise.11.d: "Although the death of the last Cypriot king was supposed to herald the beginning of Venetian rule, as his Venetian queen Catarina Corner promised us, the Cypriots have had enough of Venetian influences and are openly taking up arms on the island. It appears that if we are to seize the island of Cyprus, we must do so by means of force."
 ottoman_rise.11.a: "What a pity."
 ottoman_rise.12.t: "The Great Aq Qoyunlu"
 ottoman_rise.12.d: "For years now, we have been at odds with the Ottoman Empire, but a curious power has arisen to their empire's east. The Aq Qoyunlu, or White Sheep Turkomans, have become a significant Middle Eastern power, overcoming their ancient rivals, the Qara Qoyunlu, or Black Sheep Turkomans, and are now a real threat to the rule of the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia. Although an alliance with the Aq Qoyunlu will not guarantee the safety of our domains in the Adraitic from Ottoman incursion, it could provide a worthwhile distraction that allows us to shore up our own defenses."
 ottoman_rise.12.a: "Propose an alliance with the Aq Qoyunlu."
 ottoman_rise.12.b: "There is little to be gained from befriending such a far-off state."
 ottoman_rise.13.t: "Ambassadors from Venice"
 ottoman_rise.13.d: "The great maritime state of Venice has sent ambassadors to our lands, hoping to procure an alliance against the formidable Ottoman threat to our west. While we have overcome many foes, the Ottomans are perhaps the mightiest who have yet to be conquered, and an alliance with Venice may go a long way toward ensuring the long-term secure of our nation."
 ottoman_rise.13.a: "Very well. Let us ally Venice."
 ottoman_rise.13.b: "They are too far away to be of use."
 ottoman_rise.14.t: "The Aq Qoyunlu Accept the Alliance with Venice"
 ottoman_rise.14.d: "The tribesmen of the Aq Qoyunlu have accepted an alliance with Venice, and promise that sometime in the future, there will be a triumphant war against the Ottomans. It is an important development in our battles with the Turks."
 ottoman_rise.14.a: "Very good."
 ottoman_rise.15.t: "The Aq Qoyunlu Reject the Alliance with Venice"
 ottoman_rise.15.d: "The tribesmen of the Aq Qoyunlu have rejected an alliance with Venice, as they say we are too far to be of meaningful use to them. This may be a grave mistake given the growing Ottoman threat."
 ottoman_rise.15.a: "We will have to move alone."
 ottoman_rise.16.t: "The Ottomans Accept Moldavian Suzerainty"
 ottoman_rise.16.d: "The Ottomans have accepted our request to become their subjects, and will now protect us in all future conflicts with Poland. It is a good day in the history of our country."
 ottoman_rise.16.a: "Down with Poland!"
 ottoman_rise.17.t: "The Ottomans Reject Moldavian Suzerainty"
 ottoman_rise.17.d: "The Ottomans have rejected our request to become their subjects. As a result, we now have no allies in our future conflicts, and both the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Poland now pose colossal threats to our independence. The future is extremely uncertain."
 ottoman_rise.17.a: "Dark times draw near."
 ottoman_rise.18.t: "Aid from Venice"
 ottoman_rise.18.d: "The extremely wealthy Republic of Venice has sent our nation aid, perhaps because of the improved relations which have come about from $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ choosing a Venetian patrician's daughter for a bride. The Venetians have pledged to continue taking a keen interest in the affairs of our island, and will help us further in the future."

 ottoman_rise.19.d: "The Ottoman Empire has declared war on Wallachia, and the coming war is sure to bring profound devastation to the cities and the countryside. However, there is one small prospect of hope for defending our small country - the mighty Kingdom of Hungary to our north. If we can negotiate successfully with the Hungarians and accept their suzerainty, then they might engage themselves in our war, bringing military aid that could turn back the forces of the Turks."
 ottoman_rise.19.a: "Let us call on the aid of Hungary!"
 ottoman_rise.19.a.tooltip: "Wallachia will potentially become a march of Hungary."
 ottoman_rise.19.b: "We can fight this conflict alone."
 ottoman_rise.20.t: "The Wallachians Plead for Help"
 ottoman_rise.20.d: "Once again, the forces of the Ottoman Empire have invaded Wallachia, spreading terror, destruction, and confusion in every direction they go. However, dignitaries from Wallachia have now arrived in Hungary, and they have made us a compelling offer - if we join their war in order to fight back Ottoman forces, then Wallachia will accept our suzerainty. Nonetheless, necessity for security from the Ottoman Turks may dictate that we must defend Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.20.a: "We must aid our Christian brothers."

 ottoman_rise.20.b: "We do not have the ability to protect Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.21.t: "The Hungarians Defend Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.21.d: "The Hungarians, recognizing the gravity of the threat posed by the Ottoman Empire, have agreed to intervene in our war. It is to be hoped that with their aid, we can finally drive the Turkish menace from our borders and hopefully extinguish them as a threat to Europe."
 ottoman_rise.21.a: "We are grateful for this protection."
 ottoman_rise.22.t: "The Hungarians Abandon Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.22.d: "The Hungarians, explaining that their military resources are spent elsewhere, have refused to intervene in our war. It is suspected that they are currently fearful of and reluctant to fight the Turkish menace. Wallachia will have to stand alone."
 ottoman_rise.22.a: "The cowards!"
 ottoman_rise.23.t: "The Hungarians Intervene in Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.23.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the Kingdom of Hungary is now intervening to defend Wallachia from our incursions, with the King of Hungary proclaiming the need to maintain the unity of the Christian world against us. As a result, Hungary has joined our war and is now apparently the suzerain of Wallachia."

 ottoman_rise.24.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has always been reputed for being a harsh and stern ruler of Wallachia, but now the soldiers have begun to see a whole new side to that personality. As a result of the now ensuing conflict with the Ottomans, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s strict discipine of the soldiers has deeply intensfied, almost to the degree that the Wallachian soldiers are being treated with cruelty. Although some have deserted the army and protested our $MONARCHTITLE$, the majority of our soldiers have now steeled themselves to fight even harder, acknowledging the extreme danger posed by the Ottoman threat."

 ottoman_rise.25.d: "Recently, our Romanian brothers in Wallachia were invaded by the likes of the Ottoman Empire, who are now laying waste and pillage to their lands. If Wallachia falls to the Ottoman menace, we will inevitably be next. We can help prevent this, however, by sending military aid to Wallachia."

 ottoman_rise.26.d: "The people of Moldavia, cognizant of our ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire, have decided to send us military aid! We have received men and arms to help us in continuing our war. Of course, we will make good use of Moldavia's gifts to help ensure safety for all the Christian world."

 ottoman_rise.27.t: "The Wallachian Lands"
 ottoman_rise.27.d: "In the time before the subjugation of Wallachia, we seized some of their country's lands for ourselves, placing it under the direct administration of the Sublime Porte. However, now that Wallachia is a loyal subject of the Ottoman Empire, it may be time to return these lands to their rightful owenrs."

 ottoman_rise.28.d: "Our overlords in the Ottoman Empire have decided that it would be fitting to return the lands of Wallachia to us, acknowledging that we have become their loyal subjects. It is also possible that the Ottomans wanted to lessen the administrative burden on their bureaucracy. In any case, native rule has returned to these lands of Wallachia once again."
 ottoman_rise.28.a: "What wise overlords!"
 ottoman_rise.29.t: "The Ottomans Keep the Wallachian Lands"
 ottoman_rise.29.d: "In an absolutely outrageous decision, the Ottoman Empire has opted to keep its occupied Wallachian lands for itself! The Ottomans apparently do not see it fit to return our native lands to us, and the people of the country are angry."

 ottoman_rise.30.t: "Il Ridotto"
 ottoman_rise.30.d: "Il Ridotto was the quintessential and original European casino, a government-owned building that formalised gambling and exessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale. Eventually, people from all across Europe would come to Venice to test their luck, and hopefully make a quick fortune. While the wing of the San Moisè Palace was supposedly open to the public, only nobles could afford the high stakes played with there. While money flowed freely for more than a century, gambling was outlawed and Il Ridotto was closed in 1774."

 ottoman_rise.31.d: "For a long time now, the Transylvanian Saxons of Hungary have supported pretenders to the Wallachian throne opposed to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. They have continually refused our calls to cease their support of our enemies, perhaps feeling all too safe and secure under the authority of the Kingdom of Hungary. It is perhaps time that we do something about this situation."

 ottoman_rise.31.b: "IMPALE THEM ALL!"
 ottoman_rise.32.t: "The Impalement of the Transylvanian Saxons"
 ottoman_rise.32.d: "Along an entire stretch of road in the traditional lands of the Transylvanian Saxons, rows upon rows of impaled corpses can be found, with pikes stuck through their chests and grimacing looks of pain plastered upon their faces. The Saxons angered the ruler of Wallachia by supporting a pretender to the Wallachian throne, but little did they know that he would respond by impaling an entire Saxon village. Great devastation has been caused in the area, and we may have to respond to the barbarity of the Wallachians."
 ottoman_rise.32.a: "What is this evil?"
 impaled_saxons: "Impaled the Saxons"
 ottoman_rise.33.t: "A Wattasid Vizier"
 ottoman_rise.33.d: "Although Morocco is officially governed by the Marinid dynasty and Sultan Abdalhaqq II, in reality the country has been under the control of another dynasty, the Wattasids, for many years. Abdalhaqq's father, the previous sultan, died in an assassination after outrage against his inability to retake the city of Ceuta from Portuguese invaders led by Henry the Navigator in 1420. Although the Marinids were able to keep their hold on power, Abdalhaqq II became the new sultan, despite only being one year old. As a result, Abu Zakariya Yahya was selected as Abdalhaqq's vizier, and has maintained real control of the country ever since.\nEven though the public was extremely suspicious of Abu Zakariya Yahya, he has more than proved his worth throughout his reign. Despite not being able to retake the city of Ceuta, Abu Zakariya Yahya managed to encircle and force the surrender of a large Portuguese army camp outside Tangier in 1437, greatly restoring the morale of the Moroccan population after years of anarchy. As a result, Abu Zakariya Yahya and his family, the Wattasids, have become incredibly popular among the people, who no longer care about the increasingly irrelevant and powerless Marinid sultan."
 ottoman_rise.33.a: "But can Wattasids rule Morocco forever?"
 ottoman_rise.33.a.tooltip: "After the death of Abu Zakariya Yahya, Morocco may witness a fierce dynastic struggle between the Wattasid and Marinid dynasties."
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.d: "The great Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya has died. Remembered well for his military victories against the Portuguese after the loss of Ceuta by the previous Marinid sultan, the Moroccan population was greatly supportive of Abu Zakariya Yahya's reign, even though he was only supposed to serve in capacity as Sultan Abdalhaqq II's childhood regent. Nonetheless, Abu Zakariya Yahya's popularity was so great that the Moroccan population is willing to accept the governance of yet another Wattasid vizier, this time the nephew of Abu Yahya Zakariya. While we can allow the Wattasids to continue governing Morocco, doing so could deeply embitter $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, who may not want to cede power forever."
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.a: "There is no harm in appointing another Wattasid vizier."
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.a.tooltip: "It is possible that the Marinids will return with a vengeance to retake control of the Moroccan throne."

 ipe_flavor_mor.6.d: "Previously, we had relegated the Marinid sultan of Morocco to a role of irrelevance, forcing him to take a backseat to the Wattasid viziers who are now governing the country, continuing the legacy of Abu Zakariya Yahya. However, in a stunning turn of events, the Marinids have managed a successful coup, launching a campaign of mass murder against the Wattasid dynasty. The Marinids and their allies have taken up arms and slain the vast majority of the Wattasids, including $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, while the other remaining Wattasids have fled into hiding. Although fresh blood flows in the rivers, it seems definite that the Marinids will now rule Morocco in not just name, but reality.."

 ipe_flavor_mor.8.t: "The Cementing of Wattasid Power"
 ipe_flavor_mor.8.d: "After having governed Morocco for decades, it appears that the Wattasid dynasty has now finally secured complete control over Morocco, rendering all dynastic competitors irrelevant, including the Marinids. With the Marinid power unlikely to ever return to Morocco, it is time for $MONARCH$ to proclaim himself as the true ruler of all Morocco, and not just the vizier of a useless Sultan."
 ipe_flavor_mor.8.a: "It is the rise of a dynasty."
 ottoman_rise.34.t: "Earthquake in Constantinople"
 ottoman_rise.34.d: "In the capital of Constantinople, a great calamity has taken place. A large earthquake has caused savage destruction to the city, destroying many of its buildings and killing thousands of people, even causing a tsunami to wash up on the shores of the Bosporus. It will be extremely expensive to repair the damage, but at the same time, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s life is currently at risk should he stay in the capital, as the aftershocks are continuing and may go on for several months. However, if $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ leaves the capital, other members of the Osmanoglu dynasty may see it as an opportunity for themselves to seize the throne in the $MONARCHTITLE$'s moment of weakness."
 ottoman_rise.34.a: "We should leave the capital."
 ottoman_rise.34.b: "God will protect us!"
 ottoman_rise.35.t: "Manuel Palaiologos"
 ottoman_rise.35.d: "Following the fall of the Byzantine Empire and Constantinople to the Ottomans, the last Byzantine Emperor's son Manuel Palaiologos fled abroad, living in Rome, trying to sell his titles to the Pope in order to acquire funds large enough to maintain his personal retinue. However, the Pope continually lowballed Manuel Palaiologos, leading him to look elsewhere for payment. In a stunning and surprising move though, Manuel has now returned to Constantinople, presenting himself graciously before $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, offering to renounce his rights to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire. It would greatly benefit the legitimacy of our dynasty if we were to treat Manuel Palaiologos well where his supposed Christian allies did not."

 ottoman_rise.36.t: "The Ambition of Cem"
 ottoman_rise.36.d: "For many years, the brother to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, Cem, was the favorite to take over the Ottoman throne and lead the country. Cem has always been in a relatively powerful position, governing many of the lands in Anatolia on behalf of the $MONARCHTITLE$, but now that $MONARCH$ has become the $MONARCHTITLE$ of the Ottoman Empire, Cem has decided to definitively respond in revolt. Unless we deal with Cem quickly, the Ottoman Empire may soon find itself in ruins."
 ottoman_rise.36.a: "This is unacceptable!"

 ottoman_rise.39.t: "Sultan Cem in Rhodes"
 ottoman_rise.39.d: "Following a difficult and failed war of succession against his brother, the Ottoman Sultan, Cem Osmanoglu has fled his former realms and arrived here in the lands of the Knights Hospitaller. He seeks protection and refuge from our common Ottoman enemy, and states that he would be an excellent asset for our conflicts with the current Sultan. But his loyalty is nonetheless questionable, and we cannot just give in to the demands of an infidel. What should we do with Cem?"

The Knights are now ransoming off Cem, threatening to free him and allow him to wreak further havoc in our country if we do not pay them a large ransom. What our enemies would do with this money we do not know, but the risk of Cem going free is perhaps too great."

 ottoman_rise.41.t: "The Ottomans Pay the Knights"

 ottoman_rise.41.a: "So much money!"
 ottoman_rise.42.t: "The Ottomans Deny the Knights"
 ottoman_rise.42.d: "The Ottomans have refused to pay us a ransom to keep Cem, the pretender to their throne, imprisoned. Seeing that we have no reason to keep an infidel so dangerous to our greatest enemy, we may as well free Cem and watch him commit to further destruction of our foes."
 ottoman_rise.42.a: "Sounds excellent!"
 ottoman_rise.43.t: "The Return of Cem"
 ottoman_rise.43.d: "Previously, we defeated the armies of Cem Osmanoglu, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, and he thus fled to the lands of the Knights Hospitaller, seeking refuge and even assistance to reclaim his throne. We refused to pay the Knights a ransom to keep him imprisoned, and as a result Cem has finally returned to our territory, stirring up a new rebellion against us. If the Ottoman throne is to remain strong, these rebels must be crushed!"
