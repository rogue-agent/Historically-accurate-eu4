 ottoman_rise.1.t: "The Allegiance of Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.1.d: "Before the Battle of Varna, Wallachia was a subject of the Ottoman Empire, obligated to send troops and tribute in order to aid in the conquests of the Sultan. However, since the Battle of Varna, Wallachia has become a practically independent state teetering between the Hungarian and Ottoman spheres of influence, fearing invasion from one or the other. The time has come to deal with the difficult question of Wallachian allegiance."
 ottoman_rise.1.a: "Demand that the Wallachians pay homage."
 ottoman_rise.1.b: "We have no need for Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.2.t: "Demands from the Sublime Porte"
 ottoman_rise.2.d: "Before the Battle of Varna, Wallachia was a subject of the Ottoman Empire, obligated to send troops and tribute in order to aid in the conquests of the Sultan. However, since the Battle of Varna, Wallachia has become a practically independent state teetering between the Hungarian and Ottoman spheres of influence, fearing invasion from one or the other. It appears that the Ottomans have now sent a demand that we acknowledge them again as our suzerain, or risk the invasion and destruction of our country."
 ottoman_rise.2.a: "Very well, we will accede to their demands."
 ottoman_rise.2.b: "Impale their wretched ambassadors!"
 ottoman_rise.3.t: "Wallachia Submits!"
 ottoman_rise.3.d: "Wallachia has submitted to the authority of the Sultan once again, becoming a subject of the Ottoman Empire. It is to be hoped that there will be no more issues with their allegiance."
 ottoman_rise.3.a: "Excellent."
 ottoman_rise.4.t: "Ambassadors Impaled!"
 ottoman_rise.4.d: "The Voivode of Wallachia, enraged at our demands for suzerainty, ordered that the Ottoman diplomats be impaled and displayed their bodies outside his castle as a defiant sign of Wallachia's continued independence. It appears that if we are to take over Wallachia once again, we must resort to the use of force."
 ottoman_rise.4.a: "Uncivilized brutes!"
 ottoman_rise.5.t: "The Crisis of Moldavia"
 ottoman_rise.5.d: "For many years now, the Principality of Moldavia has been a state on the frontiers of two burgeoning realms, the Kingdom of Poland to the north and the Ottoman Empire to the south. These two fated enemies have clashed intermittently throughout the years, and much of the fighting has taken place on Moldavian soil. Despite their pledge to defend the lands of Moldavia from foreign invaders, the Ottomans have made headway into the country and conquered some of its provinces, spreading fear and terror far and wide.\nWith the Poles utterly incapable of stopping the Ottoman threat, some of the Moldavian nobles are now asking $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to abandon the Polish cause, and instead declare Moldavian suzerainty to the Ottoman Empire so that the country will no longer have to bear the brunt of the Ottoman invasions. With Poland so weak, they reason, it is better to fight them than the Ottomans.\nWe can negotiate with the Ottomans for their protection, but they may not necessarily accept our proposition. We will not be able to keep our negotiations secret from Poland, so if we do not manage to secure the suzerainty of the Ottomans, we will be left utterly defenseless."
 ottoman_rise.5.a: "A compelling suggestion. Let us try and join the Ottomans."
 ottoman_rise.5.b: "It is not worth the risk. We must stick together with Poland."
 ottoman_rise.6.t: "Moldavia Offers its Submission"
 ottoman_rise.6.d: "For many years now, the Principality of Moladvia, as a consequence of its suzerainty to Poland, has been ravaged by the troops of the Ottoman Empire. It appears that the conquest of some of the Moldavian lands and the weakness of Poland have led the Moldavian nobles to abandon Poland as an ally, for they now seek protection from us. While we could accept Moldavia as a subject, we may have to return some of their conquered lands to them in order to keep relations cordial."
 ottoman_rise.6.a: "Let us defend Moldavia from the Polish menace!"
 ottoman_rise.6.b: "We do not accept traitors."
 ottoman_rise.7.t: "The Moldavian Betrayal"
 ottoman_rise.7.d: "The Moldavian nobility, citing Poland's weakness in its conflicts against the Ottomans, have pledged their suzerainty to their empire and abandoned the Kingdom of Poland as an ally. This perfidy greatly threatens the security of the Polish state and now brings the Ottoman sphere of influence onto the very edge of our realm."
 ottoman_rise.7.a: "The fools! They will soon see the might of Poland."
 ottoman_rise.8.t: "A Venetian Queen of Cyprus"
 ottoman_rise.8.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is without a wife, and has sent dignitaries far and wide in search of one to accompany him in his rule. One potential candidate to be Queen of Cyprus is Catarina Corner, the daughter of a Venetian patrician. If we allow $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to wed Catarina, we could greatly improve our relations with the Republic of Venice. However, at the same time, arranging such a marriage could cause unforeseen complications regarding our political independence."
 ottoman_rise.8.a: "Let us take a Venetian bride."
 ottoman_rise.8.b: "We cannot trust the likes of Venice."
 ottoman_rise.9.t: "The Inheritance of Cyprus"
 ottoman_rise.9.d: "The death of the King of Cyprus has brought Venetian ambassadors... and warships. The Venetians claim that Catarina Corner has sold the island of Cyprus to their state, and that it is now a possession of the Republic. Whether Corner has done this willfully or was coerced is unknown, but whatever the case, the independence of our island is at stake."
 ottoman_rise.9.a: "Allow the Venetians to take over Cyprus."
 ottoman_rise.9.b: "Ward them off!"
 ottoman_rise.10.t: "The Inheritance of Cyprus"
 ottoman_rise.10.d: "Following the death of the last Cypriot king, his Venetian wife Catarina Corner bequeathed control of the island of Cyprus to us. We now have another foothold even deeper in the Eastern Mediterranean, from which we can continue to expand our control of regional commerce."
 ottoman_rise.10.a: "A generous gift!"
 ottoman_rise.11.t: "The Cypriots Declare Independence"
 ottoman_rise.11.d: "Although the death of the last Cypriot king was supposed to herald the beginning of Venetian rule, as his Venetian queen Catarina Corner promised us, the Cypriots have had enough of Venetian influences and are openly taking up arms on the island. It appears that if we are to seize the island of Cyprus, we must do so by means of force."
 ottoman_rise.11.a: "What a pity."
 ottoman_rise.12.t: "The Great Aq Qoyunlu"
 ottoman_rise.12.d: "For years now, we have been at odds with the Ottoman Empire, but a curious power has arisen to their empire's east. The Aq Qoyunlu, or White Sheep Turkomans, have become a significant Middle Eastern power, overcoming their ancient rivals, the Qara Qoyunlu, or Black Sheep Turkomans, and are now a real threat to the rule of the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia. Although an alliance with the Aq Qoyunlu will not guarantee the safety of our domains in the Adraitic from Ottoman incursion, it could provide a worthwhile distraction that allows us to shore up our own defenses."
 ottoman_rise.12.a: "Propose an alliance with the Aq Qoyunlu."
 ottoman_rise.12.b: "There is little to be gained from befriending such a far-off state."
 ottoman_rise.13.t: "Ambassadors from Venice"
 ottoman_rise.13.d: "The great maritime state of Venice has sent ambassadors to our lands, hoping to procure an alliance against the formidable Ottoman threat to our west. While we have overcome many foes, the Ottomans are perhaps the mightiest who have yet to be conquered, and an alliance with Venice may go a long way toward ensuring the long-term secure of our nation."
 ottoman_rise.13.a: "Very well. Let us ally Venice."
 ottoman_rise.13.b: "They are too far away to be of use."
 ottoman_rise.14.t: "The Aq Qoyunlu Accept the Alliance with Venice"
 ottoman_rise.14.d: "The tribesmen of the Aq Qoyunlu have accepted an alliance with Venice, and promise that sometime in the future, there will be a triumphant war against the Ottomans. It is an important development in our battles with the Turks."
 ottoman_rise.14.a: "Very good."
 ottoman_rise.15.t: "The Aq Qoyunlu Reject the Alliance with Venice"
 ottoman_rise.15.d: "The tribesmen of the Aq Qoyunlu have rejected an alliance with Venice, as they say we are too far to be of meaningful use to them. This may be a grave mistake given the growing Ottoman threat."
 ottoman_rise.15.a: "We will have to move alone."
 ottoman_rise.16.t: "The Ottomans Accept Moldavian Suzerainty"
 ottoman_rise.16.d: "The Ottomans have accepted our request to become their subjects, and will now protect us in all future conflicts with Poland. It is a good day in the history of our country."
 ottoman_rise.16.a: "Down with Poland!"
 ottoman_rise.17.t: "The Ottomans Reject Moldavian Suzerainty"
 ottoman_rise.17.d: "The Ottomans have rejected our request to become their subjects. As a result, we now have no allies in our future conflicts, and both the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Poland now pose colossal threats to our independence. The future is extremely uncertain."
 ottoman_rise.17.a: "Dark times draw near."
 ottoman_rise.18.t: "Aid from Venice"
 ottoman_rise.18.d: "The extremely wealthy Republic of Venice has sent our nation aid, perhaps because of the improved relations which have come about from $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ choosing a Venetian patrician's daughter for a bride. The Venetians have pledged to continue taking a keen interest in the affairs of our island, and will help us further in the future."
 ottoman_rise.18.a: "Bless the Doges of Venice!"

 ottoman_rise.19.t: "The Ottoman Invasion of Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.19.d: "The Ottoman Empire has declared war on Wallachia, and the coming war is sure to bring profound devastation to the cities and the countryside. However, there is one small prospect of hope for defending our small country - the mighty Kingdom of Hungary to our north. If we can negotiate successfully with the Hungarians and accept their suzerainty, then they might engage themselves in our war, bringing military aid that could turn back the forces of the Turks."
 ottoman_rise.19.a: "Let us call on the aid of Hungary!"
 ottoman_rise.19.a.tooltip: "Wallachia will potentially become a march of Hungary."
 ottoman_rise.19.b: "We can fight this conflict alone."
 ottoman_rise.20.t: "The Wallachians Plead for Help"
 ottoman_rise.20.d: "Once again, the forces of the Ottoman Empire have invaded Wallachia, spreading terror, destruction, and confusion in every direction they go. However, dignitaries from Wallachia have now arrived in Hungary, and they have made us a compelling offer - if we join their war in order to fight back Ottoman forces, then Wallachia will accept our suzerainty. Nonetheless, necessity for security from the Ottoman Turks may dictate that we must defend Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.20.a: "We must aid our Christian brothers."
 ottoman_rise.20.a.tooltip: "Hungary will be forced to go to war with the Ottomans."
 ottoman_rise.20.b: "We do not have the ability to protect Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.21.t: "The Hungarians Defend Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.21.d: "The Hungarians, recognizing the gravity of the threat posed by the Ottoman Empire, have agreed to intervene in our war. It is to be hoped that with their aid, we can finally drive the Turkish menace from our borders and hopefully extinguish them as a threat to Europe."
 ottoman_rise.21.a: "We are grateful for this protection."
 ottoman_rise.22.t: "The Hungarians Abandon Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.22.d: "The Hungarians, explaining that their military resources are spent elsewhere, have refused to intervene in our war. It is suspected that they are currently fearful of and reluctant to fight the Turkish menace. Wallachia will have to stand alone."
 ottoman_rise.22.a: "The cowards!"
 ottoman_rise.23.t: "The Hungarians Intervene in Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.23.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the Kingdom of Hungary is now intervening to defend Wallachia from our incursions, with the King of Hungary proclaiming the need to maintain the unity of the Christian world against us. As a result, Hungary has joined our war and is now apparently the suzerain of Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.23.a: "The fools! They only rush to their deaths!"

 ottoman_rise.24.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has always been reputed for being a harsh and stern ruler of Wallachia, but now the soldiers have begun to see a whole new side to that personality. As a result of the now ensuing conflict with the Ottomans, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s strict discipine of the soldiers has deeply intensfied, almost to the degree that the Wallachian soldiers are being treated with cruelty. Although some have deserted the army and protested our $MONARCHTITLE$, the majority of our soldiers have now steeled themselves to fight even harder, acknowledging the extreme danger posed by the Ottoman threat."
 ottoman_rise.24.a: "Fear is the best motivator."

 desc_fear_in_the_ranks: "As a result of the war with the Ottomans, our monarch has imposed extremely harsh discipline upon the armies, preparing them for all the grueling hardships that are yet to come."
 ottoman_rise.25.t: "Aid to Wallachia"
 ottoman_rise.25.d: "Recently, our Romanian brothers in Wallachia were invaded by the likes of the Ottoman Empire, who are now laying waste and pillage to their lands. If Wallachia falls to the Ottoman menace, we will inevitably be next. We can help prevent this, however, by sending military aid to Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.25.a: "Let us help the Wallachians!"
 ottoman_rise.25.b: "We cannot afford to provide aid right now."
 ottoman_rise.26.t: "Moldavia Sends Aid"
 ottoman_rise.26.d: "The people of Moldavia, cognizant of our ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire, have decided to send us military aid! We have received men and arms to help us in continuing our war. Of course, we will make good use of Moldavia's gifts to help ensure safety for all the Christian world."
 ottoman_rise.26.a: "The Moldavians are a truly gracious people."
 moldavia_sent_aid: "Sent Aid"
 ottoman_rise.27.t: "The Wallachian Lands"
 ottoman_rise.27.d: "In the time before the subjugation of Wallachia, we seized some of their country's lands for ourselves, placing it under the direct administration of the Sublime Porte. However, now that Wallachia is a loyal subject of the Ottoman Empire, it may be time to return these lands to their rightful owenrs."
 ottoman_rise.27.a: "Return these provinces to Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.27.b: "The Wallachians are unfit to rule these lands."
 ottoman_rise.27.a.tooltip: "All Ottoman provinces with Wallachian cores and Romanian culture will be returned to Wallachia."
 ottoman_rise.28.t: "The Ottomans Return the Wallachian Lands"
 ottoman_rise.28.d: "Our overlords in the Ottoman Empire have decided that it would be fitting to return the lands of Wallachia to us, acknowledging that we have become their loyal subjects. It is also possible that the Ottomans wanted to lessen the administrative burden on their bureaucracy. In any case, native rule has returned to these lands of Wallachia once again."
 ottoman_rise.28.a: "What wise overlords!"
 ottoman_rise.29.t: "The Ottomans Keep the Wallachian Lands"
 ottoman_rise.29.d: "In an absolutely outrageous decision, the Ottoman Empire has opted to keep its occupied Wallachian lands for itself! The Ottomans apparently do not see it fit to return our native lands to us, and the people of the country are angry."
